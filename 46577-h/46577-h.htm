<h2 style="page-break-before: always;">PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> years of friendship with the family of
Frederic Chopin have enabled me to become acquainted
with his letters and to place them before
the public. Just as I had finished transcribing the
first series (letters of his youth) and was on the point
of chronologically arranging the second (Paris correspondence)
the insurrection of 1863 broke out in
Poland, and the sympathy aroused by the political
condition of the Fatherland weakened public interest
in its literary and artistic productions. I therefore
deemed it advisable to abstain from the publication
of Chopinʼs letters.</p>

<p>When I gave back to his family the original
letters, I did not dream that in a few months they
would be destroyed. How this happened I shall
in the proper place explain. The loss is a great
and irreparable one, for the number of letters from
Paris, during a most brilliant and interesting epoch,
was by no means inconsiderable.</p>

<p>In compliance with the wishes of many of Chopinʼs<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
friends and admirers, I have undertaken to sketch
his career from the materials afforded me by his one
surviving sister, from his letters which I published
in Warsaw, and from some other letters to his
friends.</p>

<p>In this work, which contains full particulars about
Chopinʼs youth, I have corrected the erroneous dates
and mis-statements, which have found their way
into all the German and French periodicals and
books. If I should succeed in presenting the reader
with a life-like portrait of the immortal artist, it will
be the highest reward of my labour of love.</p>

the year 1787 Warsaw was in a state of
unwonted excitement, for the thoughts of the
people were attracted to and concentrated upon
the Diet, that was shortly to assemble for the
purpose of preserving the Polish nation from the
miseries incident to anarchy, for upholding the
Republic, remodelling old and defective laws, and
framing new ones in harmony with the requirements
of the times.</p>

<p>A radical reform of the effete Constitution was
considered by high State functionaries, the clergy,
and by the old nobility, to be necessary. Admittedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
the Republic ought to be strong enough to protect
itself against hostile foreign influence, or a repetition
of the dismemberment of 1773. Consequently, an
imposing standing army was organized, and, for the
purpose of raising the <i>status</i> of the citizens, special
privileges were granted to the trading classes, and
the serfs were emancipated. Indeed, the patriots
were desirous of making all classes politically equal.</p>

<p>The election of members for the Diet was conducted
in a spirit of true patriotic zeal, and nearly
all classes in Warsaw were taking part in the necessary
arrangements. Many of the noblest families
removed to the capital. Foreign ambassadors attended
the palace to ascertain the intentions of King
Stanislas Augustus respecting the thorough reforms
required by the people. The chariots of the highest
official functionaries, Wojewoden, and Kastellane,
frequently accompanied by outriders in their gorgeous
national costume, and carriages, filled with
elegantly dressed ladies, rolled along the streets;
while everywhere there prevailed a bustle and excitement
long unknown in Warsaw.</p>

<p>The whole nation was inspired by the hope of a
brighter future. The nobility were to aid a peaceful
revolution by voluntarily renouncing their privileges
in favour of a younger generation. The future Republic
was viewed in the most glowing light. Notwithstanding
the recent partition which had rent the
very heart of the country, and narrowly circumscribed
its boundaries, every patriot believed that Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
would now rise from the degradation caused by long
years of anarchy, and, strengthened with new energy,
defy every danger.</p>

<p>No wonder the inhabitants of the capital witnessed
the preparations for the important Diet with enthusiasm,
or that the streets were thronged with people.
Members of the aristocracy, famous for their patriotism
and willing self-sacrifice for the good both of
the people and the Republic, were universally greeted
with genuine esteem and affection. Such was the
scene of stirring activity presented by the capital
during the preparations for the quadrennial Diet.</p>

<p>Among the crowds which thronged the chief
thoroughfares was a young Frenchman, just arrived
from his own country. Everything that met his
eye—from the dress of the burgher to the gorgeous
apparel of the rich noble, who at that time generally
wore the picturesque national costume—fixed his
attention, and appeared to him unusually interesting
and original. This stranger was Nicholas Chopin,
father of the renowned pianist and tone-poet.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">NICHOLAS CHOPIN.</span>
Nicholas Chopin was born at Nancy, in Lorraine,
April 17th, 1770. The duchies of Lorraine and Bar
passed, as is well-known, by the peace of Vienna, in
1735, into the possession of the King of Poland,
Stanislas Leszczynski, after whose death they reverted
to France.</p>

<p>Stanislas Leszczynski, a constant friend to science
and art, made great efforts for the spread of general
culture among his people; he founded, at Nancy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
still-existing “Academie Stanislai,” and by his just
and mild rule won the undivided esteem and affection
of his subjects. Nicholas Chopin was born when the
remembrance of this prince and philosopher was still
in its first freshness. It had long been the desire of
Chopin, and many other educated Lorrainers, who
knew something of the history of Poland, to visit the
country of the exiled monarch who ruled their own
little land, and to become acquainted with a nation
which, despite its own needs, was ever ready to
assist the wants of others.</p>

<p>An opportunity soon presented itself. The Starostin
Lacynska, who met Nicholas Chopin, at Nancy,
and was prepossessed by his highly cultured mind
and amiable manners, offered him the appointment
of tutor to her two children, which he readily accepted.
Bidding adieu to his family and friends,
he followed the Starostin, and arrived in Warsaw
during the political agitation of 1787.</p>

<p>During his residence with Starostin Lacynska, in
the city, and at the village of Czerniejow, the young
Frenchman became acquainted with many important
official personages, some of whom played a prominent
part in the Diet.</p>

<p>He early perceived that a study of the manners
and customs of the people required a thorough
knowledge of the language, and in that acquisition
he soon made considerable progress. The discussions
in the Diet interested him much, because
they revealed the many wrongs inflicted on a nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
which, under the sceptre of the Jagiellons, had been
among the most powerful and distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE NEW POLISH CONSTITUTION.</span>
Nicholas Chopin, also, witnessed some important
political celebrations in Warsaw. The proclamation
of the new Constitution of the 3rd May, 1791, made
a deep and permanent impression upon him.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>With the exception of a few obstinately prejudiced
aristocrats, the results of the Diet were received by
the whole nation with unexampled enthusiasm. The
joy of the people of Warsaw was unbounded, and
everyone hoped for a return of the golden age of
Poland, as the reign of Sigismund August II. has
been rightly called.</p>

<p>As Nicholas Chopin found his social pleasures
exclusively among Polish circles, he began to regard
Poland as his second home, and heartily sympathised
with the memorable act which promised brighter
fortunes to the land of the Sarmatians. The recollection
of this period never faded from his memory,
and he would often describe to his family the
transport and enthusiasm of the people who thought
its future happiness assured by a firm government,
the equality of all classes before the law, and a
standing army of 100,000 men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately these bright hopes were but short
lived. Jealous neighbours, to whose interests the
re-organization and strengthening of Poland were
inimical, foreswore its downfall. Contrary to all
principles of justice, for Poland had not in the
smallest degree meddled in her affairs, Russia was
the first to take up arms, under the pretext of opposing
the Jacobite tenets of the Constitution and of
restoring to the nobles the power taken from them
by the people. The lust of power and the corruptibility
of certain magnates were used by the Russian
government for its own iniquitous ends, and the
good laws decreed by the quadrennial Diet never
came into operation.</p>

<p>Frederick William II.,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> of Prussia—although he
professed friendship for Poland, praised the Constitution,
and on March 29th, 1790, concluded, through
his ambassador in Warsaw, Lucchesini, an offensive
and defensive alliance, guaranteeing the national
independence—did not hesitate to enter into a mutual
engagement with Russia for a second partition of
Poland, by which he received, in the year 1793, an
area of 1,100 square miles, in the neighbourhood of
Dantzic and Thorn. From this time until its total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
annihilation, one misfortune after another beset the
sorely tried nation. When the weak and vacillating
King Stanislas Augustus not only deserted his people,
because they defended their independence and the
Constitution of May 3rd, but even joined the Russian
party, the great Polish families, one by one, left
Warsaw for more secure abodes.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">NICHOLAS IN THE NATIONAL GUARDS.</span>
Nicholas Chopin, having lost his appointment with
Starostin Lacynska, resolved to leave the country;
illness, however, forced him to remain in Warsaw.
He, therefore, witnessed, in 1794, the revolution of
which Kosciuszko was the hero, and also the siege
of the capital by the Prussians. Brave by nature,
and zealous for the independence of Poland, Nicholas
Chopin entered the ranks of the National Guards,
and took an active part in the defence of the country.
He had attained the position of captain at the time
of the defeat of the Polish army at Maciejowice,
when Kosciuszko was severely wounded and taken
prisoner, and overwhelming forces were marching on
the suburb of Praga. Nicholas Chopin was ordered
thither with his company, and his death would have
been inevitable had he not been relieved from his
post by another company a few hours before the
occupation.</p>

<p>It is notorious that, after the capture of Praga,
November 5th, 1794, Suwarow ordered his troops
to kill all the inhabitants, old men, women, and
children not excepted. More than 10,000 persons
fell victims to the conquerorʼs cruelty. The third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
partition of Poland, which was accomplished in the
following year, gave the death blow to its political
existence. Poland disappeared from the ranks of
nations, and figured only on the map of Europe in
fragments, incorporated with other States. Warsaw
alone was under Prussian supremacy.</p>

<p>After passing through this stormy period, Nicholas
Chopin once more resolved to return to France; but
was again seized by a severe illness, which forbade
him undergoing the fatigue and delay which the
long journey at that time involved. He, therefore,
remained in Warsaw, and supported himself by
giving lessons in French. When asked why he
had abandoned the idea of returning to his own
country, he used to reply: “I have twice made the
attempt, but was prevented both times by a severe
illness, which almost cost me my life; it seems to
be the will of Providence that I should stay in
Poland, and I willingly submit.”</p>

<p>In the beginning of the present century we find
Nicholas Chopin established in the house of the
Countess Skarbek, as tutor to her son. He there
met and fell in love with Fräulein Justine Krzyzanowska,
whom, in 1806, he married. Their union
was blessed with three daughters and one son.
Count Frederic Skarbek was god-father to the latter,
and gave him his own baptismal name, “Frederic.”</p>

<p>While little Fredericʼs parents were rejoicing in
his growth and development, the political condition
of Poland again changed. The formation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Grand Duchy of Warsaw, by Napoleon I., in the
year 1807, on the basis of the peace of Tilsit, aroused
the Poles from the political death sleep into which
they had sunk after the last partition of their
country. Raised by the successful conqueror to
the importance of an actual capital, Warsaw became
the centre of action, animating and concentrating
all the powers of the newly-made Duchy. Thither
everyone eagerly repaired. With impetuous haste a
government was organized, a soldiery formed, and
new schools established. Following the general
example, Nicholas Chopin returned with his family
to Warsaw, where he would be able to work with
greater advantage both to himself and to the country
<span class="sidenote">APPOINTMENTS IN WARSAW.</span>
of his adoption. On October 1st, 1810, he was appointed
Professor of French at the newly established
Lyceum, where he continued in active work for
twenty-one years, that is, until its overthrow by
the Russian government. On January 1st, 1812, he
entered on similar duties at the School of Artillery
and Engineering.</p>

<p>When the kingdom of Poland had been restored,
on the basis of the Congress of Vienna, principally
out of those portions which had previously formed
the Grand Duchies, Nicholas Chopin undertook the
professorship of French at the Military Elementary
School. The insurrection of November 29th, 1830,
which had awakened among Polish patriots hopes of
deliverance from Russian domination, ended in total
discomfiture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Fresh misfortunes visited the country. The most
intelligent portion of the nation and the representatives
of the government emigrated, the army was
disbanded, the universities removed, the Lyceum and
other educational establishments closed. Nicholas
Chopin was a member of the Examining Committee
for candidates for appointments in the public
schools, and finally became professor at the Academy
for Roman Catholic Clergy.</p>

<p>The strenuous exertions undertaken by Chopin,
out of love for his adopted country, induced a
gradual failure of his powers; he, therefore, accepted
a pension, and retired from public life. His integrity
and noble-mindedness, his dignity under adverse
fortune, and the blameless purity of his life, caused
him to be highly respected in the country he had
made his own. The best Polish families were
anxious to entrust the training of their sons to his
care, and to place them in a household universally
esteemed, so that for some years Nicholas Chopin
had the charge of a considerable number of youths
who were educated with his own son Frederic.
Anxiety about his son did much to becloud the last
years of his life. Amid the devoted care of his family
Nicholas Chopin died, in 1844, aged seventy-four.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">NICHOLAS CHOPINʼS FAMILY.</span>
Justine Chopin, who had shared all her husbandʼs
joys and troubles, was of an exceedingly gentle disposition,
and excelled in all womanly virtues. The
fame of her son Frederic, did not render her in
the least haughty. Domestic peace was her highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
happiness. Providence afflicted her with severe
trials: after the death of her husband she lost two
amiable daughters, and then her only and dearly
loved son, the last moments of whose life she was
unable to soothe by her motherly care. But these
afflictions were borne with touching patience. In
extreme old age she lived in the house of her one
surviving daughter; her last days were devoted
almost entirely to prayer, and she never went out
except to church. She died October 1st, 1861.</p>

<p>Louisa, the eldest child, born April 6th, 1807,
received a very careful education, and soon became
a great help to her parents. She was distinguished
by unusual intellectual gifts, industry, and very
agreeable manners. In conjunction with her sister,
Isabella, she wrote some books on the best means
for the elevation of the working classes. After her
marriage with Professor Jedrzejewicz, in 1832, she
devoted herself to the education of her children, and
gave less attention to literature. She did not, however,
entirely lay aside her pen, but wrote and
published, in various journals, papers and articles
on the education of youth. She died October 29th,
1855.</p>

<p>Nicholas Chopinʼs second daughter, Isabella,
married the Inspector of Schools, Anton Barcinski,
who afterwards became Director of Steamboats.
They are both still living in Warsaw.</p>

<p>Emily, the youngest daughter, a very attractive
girl, of whom the highest hopes were entertained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
died in her fourteenth year, April 10th, 1827.
Educated beyond her years, unceasingly bright and
witty, she possessed the happy gift of always diffusing
cheerfulness. She was, therefore, much beloved,
and her wit, affectionate flattery, or droll mimicry,
often prevailed with her parents when her elder
sistersʼ and even her brotherʼs influence had been of
no avail.</p>

<p>Thirsting for knowledge, she worked untiringly.
The writings of the principal Polish authors, such
as Clementine and Tanska, had so deeply impressed
her, that she made it the aim of her
life to become an authoress. She, therefore,
at an early age, zealously studied her mother
tongue, which she soon succeeded in mastering.
Some poems which she wrote for special occasions
were distinguished by blameless form and harmony;
even in her thirteenth year Emily and her sister
Isabella were engaged in translating into Polish the
tales of the German writer, Salzmann; but her
early death, unfortunately, prevented the completion
of this work. Judging from such of her poetical
effusions as still remain, it may be assumed, that
had she lived, Emily would have attained as brilliant
a position in Polish literature as her brother
has in music. She suffered from an incurable complaint
of the chest, and, in her last moments, seeing
the suffering and despair of the relatives around her,
she repeated the lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Wie bitter ist des Menschen Loos auf Erden,</div>
<div class="line">Sieht er wie um <i>sein</i> Leid, die <i>Seinen</i> traurig werden.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus, at the early age of fourteen, passed away
this talented girl, whose premature intellectual
development was so remarkable.</p>

<p>In contemplating the family of Frederic Chopin
we see his own character in its fairest light, and
understand how he became what he was. In a
certain sense a human being resembles a plant:
nationality, parents, family, friends, and teachers,
all have a share in his development. Happy the
man who regards his parents with loving reverence,
who rejoices in good brothers and sisters and excellent
teachers.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DR. AND MADAME VON LINDE.</span>
One of Nicholas Chopinʼs oldest friends was his
colleague and superior, the famous philologist, Dr.
Samuel Bogumil von Linde, who earned the thanks
of the whole nation by the compilation of his valuable
Polish dictionary. His merit is so much the
greater as, independently of the labours of Wilhelm
von Humboldt and Bopp, he applied the comparative
and historical method to his work, thus
rendering it, to speak accurately, a parallel comparison
of the Slavonic languages.</p>

<p>Frederic Chopin often played duets with Madame
von Linde, who was an unusually well educated
woman, and a remarkable pianist for her time.
To her Chopin dedicated his first published work,
Rondo, op. 1. This composition was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
instalment of the rare treasures with which he
has enriched the literature of music.</p>

<p>Another of Nicholas Chopinʼs colleagues was
Waclaw Alexander Maciejowski, celebrated for his
researches in history and Slavonic law. His works
are much valued by students, and have been translated
into several languages.</p>

<p>Among others who were from time to time
Nicholas Chopinʼs guests were: Count Skarbek,
an excellent author, foster-son to Nicholas, and
god-father to Frederic Chopin; the Professors of
the University, Brodzinski, poet and student of
aesthetics; Julius Kolberg, an engineer, father of
the ethnologist Oskar, the indefatigable collector
of folk songs; Jarocki, a learned zoologist; Anton
Brodowski, a celebrated historical and portrait
painter; Anton Barcinski, Professor at the Polytechnic
school since 1823, teacher in the hostʼs
<i>pension</i>, and afterwards his son-in-law; Jawurek, a
talented musician; and last of all Chopinʼs two
masters, Zywny and Elsner.</p>

<p>Adalbert Zywny, born in Bohemia, in 1756, came
to Poland in the reign of Stanislas Augustus.
His first appointment was that of music teacher
in the house of Prince Casimir Sapiecha; then he
settled in Warsaw as teacher of the piano. He
died in 1840.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">JOSEPH ELSNER.</span>
Of Elsner I must speak more particularly, because,
as Chopinʼs master for counterpoint, he first
discovered his pupilʼs creative originality, and by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
guidance and counsel assisted considerably in the
development of his talent for composition. Frederic,
therefore, not only loved and valued Elsner as a
teacher, but also as an intimate friend. As will be
seen, his name frequently occurs in Chopinʼs letters.
In Germany Elsner is almost unknown as a composer,
although he rendered good service to church music.</p>

<p>Joseph Xaver Elsner was born June 29th, 1769,
at Grottkau, in Silesia. His father, who was an
instrument maker, wished him to study medicine,
but Joseph preferred to devote himself to music.
Maar, bandmaster at Breslau, gave him his first
instruction in counterpoint. In 1792, Elsner went
to Poland, holding the post of bandmaster and composer
at the National Theatre, first at Lemberg and
then in Warsaw. In 1816, after the proclamation
of the institution of the new kingdom by the
Congress of Vienna, he was entrusted with the
establishment of a school for organists, and six
years after with the direction of the Conservatoire.</p>

<p>Besides the German operas, “Die Seltenen Brüder,”
“Der Verkleidete Sultan,” and “Il Flauto
Magico,” which Eisner composed at Lemberg, he
wrote twenty-seven Polish operas and melodramas,
a great number of arias, cantatas, string quartets,
and three symphonies, besides several ecclesiastical
works, among which the oratorio, “Das Leiden
Christi” was several times performed in Warsaw,
and very favourably received. Its wealth of melody,
no less than its technical working, renders this one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of the chief, and, perhaps, the most successful of
Elsnerʼs compositions. He also rendered great
services to Poland, as teacher and director at the
Conservatoire. He trained a considerable number
of talented young men, who afterwards became
excellent musicians, and otherwise promoted the
cultivation of music in the noblest manner. He
died April 18th, 1854.</p>

<p>A magnificent monument, raised by public subscription,
adorns his tomb in Warsaw.</p>

<p>Titled landowners were also included in the circle
of Nicholas Chopinʼs friends. Most of them had
been his pupils, or had become acquainted with him
through their sons. In later years, when Fredericʼs
rare and brilliant talents were more fully developed,
his father counted among his guests not only <i>savants</i>,
poets, and artists, but the <i>élite</i> of the aristocracy,
who considered it an honour to become acquainted
with this interesting and highly esteemed family,
and delighted in admiring the young artist for whom
a glorious future was already prophesied. These
were bright and happy days passed by Chopin in
his fatherʼs house.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">
<i>FREDERICʼS CHILDHOOD. HIS FIRST
APPEARANCE IN PUBLIC.
IMPROVISATIONS. POLISH NATIONAL SONGS.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 40px;">
<img src="images/o.jpg" width="40" height="60" alt="I" /></span>N March 1st, 1809, Frederic François Chopin
was born, at Zelazowa Wola, a village six
miles from Warsaw, belonging to Count Skarbek, in
whose house Nicholas Chopin was tutor.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>In his earliest years Frederic was so very sensitive
to music that he wept whenever he heard it, and
was with difficulty restrained. This powerful influence
was not a painful one; for Frederic soon
showed such a decided love for the piano, that his
parents obtained instruction for him, selecting as
his master the well-known and excellent teacher,
Albert Zywny, of Warsaw. As Frederic was so
young, his elder sister shared the music lessons.</p>

<p>Zywny was the first and only director of Fredericʼs
precocious musical talents, for the child began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>compose before he even knew how to commit his
ideas to paper. He would request his master to
write down what he improvised, and these first
thoughts were afterwards frequently altered and
improved by the gifted boy.</p>

<p>Thus early did he indicate his future care in
composition, and his truly artistic nature. In a
few years Frederic made such progress in pianoforte
playing as to excite wonder in all Warsaw
drawing rooms. On the occasion of a public
concert, for the benefit of the poor, February 24th,
1818, Julius Ursin Miemcewicz, late adjutant to
Kosciuszko, and himself a great statesman, poet,
historian, and political writer, and other high personages,
invited the co-operation of the virtuoso,
who had not quite completed his ninth year. Such
a request could not be refused, and thus Chopinʼs
first step in his artistic career was for a charitable
object. A few hours before the performance
(he was to play Gyrowetzʼs pianoforte Concerto),
“Fritzchen,” as he was called at home, was placed
on a chair to be suitably dressed for his first
appearance before a large assembly. The child
was delighted with his jacket, and especially with
the handsome collar. After the concert, his mother,
who had not been present, asked, as she embraced
him, “what did the public like best?” He naïvely
answered: “Oh, mamma, everybody looked only at
my collar,” thus showing that he was not vain of
his playing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PATRONIZED BY THE CHIEF ARISTOCRACY.</span>
From that evening the flower of the aristocracy
vied with each other in patronizing the marvellous
boy, whom they regarded as an ornament of their
<i>salons</i>. We merely mention the Princes Czartoryski,
Sapiecha, Czetwertynski, Lubecki, Radziwill, Counts
Skarbek, Wolicki, Pruszak, Hussarzewski, Lempicki.
The Princess Czetwertynski introduced him to the
Princess Lowicka, the unhappy wife of the Grand
Prince Constantin Pawlowicz. Young, bewitchingly
beautiful, full of intelligence and grace, her charms
won the affections of the Grand Prince, who shunned
no sacrifice to make her his own. His passion for
this beautiful woman only temporarily modified his
harshness and violence, and, in her wretched life, the
enjoyment of art was her one solace.</p>

<p>Accustomed in his fatherʼs house to good society,
and now having the <i>entrée</i> of the first <i>salons</i> in the
capital, refined surroundings became to Frederic a
second nature, and gave him the life-long impress
of a gentleman. He always had an aversion to
coarse people, and avoided anyone who lacked good
manners.</p>

<p>Catalini, when passing through Warsaw, became
acquainted with the youthful virtuoso, and was
delighted with his artistic pianoforte playing. As
a grateful recognition of the enjoyment he had
afforded her, she presented him with a gold watch,
on the back of which was inscribed: “Donné par
Madame Catalini à Frédéric Chopin, agé de dix
ans.” Fredericʼs earliest compositions were dances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Polonaises, Mazurkas, Waltzes; then he accomplished
a March, which he ventured to dedicate
to the Grand Prince Constantine. This violent
man, the terror of those around him, was often
very kind to the little artist; he accepted the
dedication very graciously, and desired Frederic to
play the piece to him. Fortunately for the young
composer the Prince liked it, and he walked up
and down while it was being played, smiling and
beating time with the utmost complacency. He
had the March<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> scored, and it was often performed
at the military parade, in the Saxon Square.</p>

<p>Frederic occasionally improvised in the drawing
room of the Grand Princess. Noticing his habit
of casting up his eyes and gazing at the ceiling,
the Prince said to him: “Why do you always
look upwards, boy? do you see notes up there?”
Probably Chopin saw nothing around him when
listening to the voice of his genius.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">EXTENDED AND DISSEVERED CHORDS.</span>
From contemporary observers we learn with what
perseverance he laboured to overcome the technical
difficulties of the pianoforte. Impressed by the good
effect of a chord with the dominant in the higher
octave, but unable to play it with his small hand,
he endeavoured to produce the desired expansion
by a mechanical contrivance of his own manufacture,
which he kept between his fingers even during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
night. He was not led to use this aid by a desire of
fame or of forestalling others, in inventing and surmounting
new difficulties, but because he perceived
the difference between a slurred and a detached
chord. These chords became a characteristic feature
in Chopinʼs compositions. At first they were thought
almost impossible for systematic use, but players
grew accustomed to them, and now no pianist finds
them unsuited to the capacities of the hand.</p>

<p>The refinement and elegance of Chopinʼs musical
ideas, and his obvious desire for the frequent use of
extended chords, already reveal his peculiar <i>penchant</i>
for new, dissevered chords. Perceiving Fredericʼs
uncommon talent for composition, his father had
him instructed in counterpoint, as far as was compatible
with his preparation for the Warsaw Lyceum,
not having as yet entertained the idea of making
him an artist. Nicholas Chopin made a most
fortunate choice in asking his friend, Elsner, to
become Fredericʼs instructor. Teacher and pupil
were united till death, in a pure and faithful friendship,
such as only the noblest minds can feel.
When people remarked to Elsner, as they frequently
did, that Frederic under-rated and set aside the
customary rules and universal laws of music, and
listened only to the dictates of his own fancy, the
worthy director of the Conservatoire would reply:
“Leave him alone, he does not follow the common
way because his talents are uncommon; he does not
adhere to the old method because he has one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
own, and his works will reveal an originality hitherto
unknown.” This prophecy has been fully fulfilled.
A less discerning teacher might have hindered and
repressed his pupilʼs efforts, and so quenched the
desire for loftier flights. To the astonishment of
his friends, Frederic excelled in everything he
undertook, and they formed the most brilliant
expectations of his future. Extraordinary vivacity of
temperament prompted him to incessant activity,
and sharpened his innate, irrepressible, and versatile
humour. What innumerable tricks he was
continually playing on his sisters, schoolfellows,
and even on persons of riper years! His youngest
sister, Emily, was an active assistant in these
merry pranks.</p>

<p>The birthdays of his parents and intimate friends
were frequently celebrated by theatrical representations,
in which Frederic usually took the most
active part. The eminent dramatic artist of that
time, Albert Piasecki, who acted as manager at
these representations, considered that Chopin, on
account of his presence of mind, excellent declamation,
and capacity for rapid facial changes, was
born to be a great actor. Fredericʼs acting, indeed,
often astonished the best connoisseurs. He frequently
saved a piece by improvising his own and
other parts, when one of the players forgot his <i>rôle</i>,
or the prompter failed to assist. It is well known
that his talent for musical improvisation contributed
in no small degree in after years to his fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>Having, under the excellent guidance of Elsner,
mastered the technicalities of music, Chopin could
improvise to an unlimited extent on any given
theme, producing the most graceful changes, and
drawing the most marvellous effects from the keyboard.
In these improvisations, and particularly
in those of a later period, Chopin showed himself
a true poet, and this explains why poets admired
him so ardently and felt inspired by his playing.
Those who heard Chopin at such times say that
his finest compositions are but a reflex and echo
<span class="sidenote">HIS ONE-ACT COMEDY IN VERSE.</span>
of his improvisations. When Frederic was fifteen,
and Emily eleven, they wrote in honour of their
fatherʼs birthday, a one-act comedy, in verse, entitled:
“The Mistake; or, the Imaginary Rogue.”
Frederic, Isabella, and Emily took the principal
parts, the others were divided among the boarders.
The comedy is too ephemeral and näive for quotation,
but it displayed the intelligence of the youthful
authors, and their command of language. In the
same year (1824) Frederic entered the fourth class
at the Lyceum, and although he frequently indulged
in his harmless and always witty pranks, he was
one of the best and most talented pupils. He used
to make his fellow students laugh by caricaturing the
professor of history discoursing on great celebrities.
In a lucky moment, he caricatured the director,
Mons. Linde, to the life, but unfortunately the drawing
fell into the directorʼs hands. This worthy man,
who was indulgent to everyone, and especially to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
young, returned the paper to Chopin, without a
word, having written on it, “the likeness is well
drawn.” For a long time Frederic took a delight in
catching the ludicrous side of a characteristic figure,
and caricaturing it.</p>

<p>He spent his first holidays in Mazovia, at the
village of Szafarnia, which belonged to the Dziewanowski
estate, where he soon formed a warm and
lasting friendship with the children of this distinguished
family. To any boy brought up in a
city, a stay of several weeks in the country is a
time full of freedom and delight; and how infinitely
greater would be the enjoyment of a gifted boy like
Chopin when, unburdened by school exercises, he
can wander through wood and meadow, dreaming of
fairies and wood-nymphs. Frederic, who was not
at all fond of long, fatiguing walks, loved to lie
under a tree, and indulge in beautiful day-dreams.
Instead of an ordinary correspondence it occurred to
him to bring out a little periodical under the title of
the <i>Kurjer Szafarski</i>, on the model of the <i>Warsaw
Courier</i>, a paper then published in the capital.
Among the memorials of Frederic, collected by the
family are two numbers of this little journal, for
the year 1824. At the beginning of the first number
we read: “On July 15th, M. Pichon (a name
Frederic assumed) appeared at the musical assembly
at Szafarnia, at which were present several persons,
big and little: he played Kalkbrennerʼs Concerto,
but this did not produce such a <i>furore</i>, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
among the youthful hearers, as the song which the
same gentleman rendered.” It happened that a
great many Jews were at that time in the neighbouring
village of Oborów (the property of M.
Romocki) to buy grain. Frederic invited some of
<span class="sidenote">“HE PLAYS LIKE A BORN JEW.”</span>
them to his room, and played to them a kind of
Jewish wedding March, called “Majufes.” His
performance excited such enthusiasm among his
guests that they not only began to dance, but
earnestly begged him to come to an approaching
Jewish marriage, and give them some more of his
exquisite music. “He plays,” said the delighted
Israelites, “like a born Jew.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>The remainder of the news of the <i>Kurjer Szfarski</i>
consisted of humorous descriptions of the daily
events of the village. A strange glimpse of the
condition of Poland is afforded by the fact, that
according to a custom, which even now prevails in
Warsaw, each issue of this journal was examined
by the government censor, whose business it was to
write on every number, “lawful for transmission.”
The office was at that time held by Mlle. Louise
Dziewanowska, daughter of the proprietor of Szafarnia.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate all the jokes
and harmless mysteries which this famous man
indulged in during the happy days of boyhood, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>I will mention a few of his merry tricks, for the sake
of those who linger with affectionate interest over
his early years.</p>

<p>Mons. Romocki, the proprietor of Oborów, once
sold his wheat to a Jewish merchant. Hearing of
the purchase, Frederic wrote a letter in the Polo-Jewish
style, purporting to come from the buyer,
and stating that, after mature consideration, he
found he should be a loser by the bargain, and,
therefore, declined it. The writing was abominable,
the spelling full of blunders, but the deception succeeded
so well that Romocki was in a frightful rage.
He sent for the Jew instantly, and would probably
have soundly belaboured the unfortunate merchant
had not Frederic confessed his mischievous trick
in time. Romocki laughed at the joke, and was
on his guard against being taken in again by
Frederic. The deeper meaning underlying all the
acts of this accomplished man in later years showed
itself even here. Romocki was ashamed of his fury,
and it is said from that day he very rarely, and only
from necessity, took a whip in his hand.</p>

<p>Between 1820 and 1830 there was an Evangelical
pastor in Warsaw, named Tetzner, who preached
every Sunday in German and Polish alternately, and
from his defective knowledge of the language, proclaimed
the truths of the gospel in very broken
Polish. Being led into his church from curiosity,
Frederic was at once struck by the droll speech of
the preacher, and carefully noticed every wrongly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
pronounced word. When he reached home, he
constructed a kind of pulpit with tables and chairs,
put on a whig, and, summoning the family, delivered
a discourse in imitation of the pastorʼs broken
Polish, which was so ludicrous that his hearers
burst into roars of laughter.</p>

<p>If his fatherʼs pupils made too much noise in the
house, Frederic had only to place himself at the
piano to produce instant and perfect quiet. One day
when Professor Chopin was out there was a frightful
scene. Barcinski, the master present, was at
his witsʼ end, when Frederic, happily, entered the
room.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Without deliberation he requested the roisterers
to sit down, called in those who were making
a noise outside, and promised to improvise an interesting
story on the piano, if they would be quite
<span class="sidenote">CHILDREN SPELL-BOUND BY HIS PLAYING.</span>
quiet. All were instantly as still as death, and
Frederic sat down to the instrument and extinguished
the lights.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> He described how robbers
approached a house, mounted by ladders to the
windows, but were frightened away by a noise
within. Without delay they fled on the wings of
the wind into a deep, dark wood, where they fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>asleep under the starry sky. He played more and
more softly, as if trying to lull children to rest,
till he found that his hearers had actually fallen
asleep. The young artist noiselessly crept out of
the room, to his parents and sisters, and asked
them to follow him with a light. When the family
had amused themselves with the various postures
of the sleepers, Frederic sat down again to the
piano, and struck a thrilling chord, at which they all
sprang up in a fright. A hearty laugh was the
<i>finale</i> of this musical joke.</p>

<p>Further on in his life we meet with a companion
picture to this story, which affords us an excellent
example of Fredericʼs talent for improvisation, profound
knowledge of counterpoint, and mastery over
all technical difficulties. Like all gifted and accomplished
musicians, he showed an especial preference
for the organ as offering wide scope for the freest
improvisation. It was customary for the students of
the Warsaw University to assemble about eleven in
the morning for service at the Wizytek Church, at
which artists and <i>dilettanti</i> performed vocal masses
with and without orchestral accompaniments.</p>

<p>Chopin sometimes sat in the choir and played the
organ. One day when the celebrant had sung the
“Oremus,” Frederic improvised, in a highly ingenious
manner, on the motive of the portion of
the mass already performed, working out the fundamental
thought with the most interesting combinations
and contrapuntal devices. The choristers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
and band, spell-bound by the magic power of his
fancy, left their desks, and surrounded the player,
listening with rapt attention, as if they had been
in the concert room rather than the church. The
priest, at the altar, patiently awaited the conclusion,
but the sacristan rushed angrily into the choir, exclaiming:
“what the d—— are you doing? The
priest has twice intoned, <i>Per omnia sæcula sæculorum</i>,
the ministrant has rung repeatedly, and still you
keep on playing. The superior who sent me is out
<span class="sidenote">HIS REVERIE IN CHURCH.</span>
of all patience.” Chopin awoke from his reverïe,
and his hands lay motionless on the keys. Although
his wonderful improvisations generally cost him but
little trouble, he spared no pains when preparing a
work for publication. When absorbed by a thought
he would brood over it for hours and days in perfect
silence and solitude. What passed in the soul of
the tone-poet at these seasons cannot be described;
with such psychological conditions the imaginative
can sympathise, and all who are sensible to the
influences of poetry and art may in some measure
understand.</p>

<p>Chopin had an instrument in his bed-room, and
often worked far on into the night; sometimes when
the rest of the household were asleep, he would
spring out of bed, rush to his piano, and strike a
few chords, developing some immatured thought, or
resolving some imperfect harmony. Then he would
lie down, but only to rise and do the same thing
again, daylight frequently finding him thus occupied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
The servants, by whom Frederic was much beloved,
but who could not understand such proceedings,
shook their heads compassionately, and said, “The
poor young gentlemanʼs mind is affected.”</p>

<p>When on an excursion with his father to the
suburbs, or spending his holidays in the country, he
always listened attentively to the song of the reaper,
and the tune of the peasant fiddler, fixing in his
memory and delighting to idealise these frequently
original and expressive melodies. He often wondered
who was the creator of the beautiful melodies interwoven
in the Mazurkas, Cracoviennes, and Polonaises,
and how the Polish peasants learnt to sing
and play the violin with such purity. No one could
give him any information. Indeed both the words
and melodies of these songs are the creation of
several minds. An artless, spontaneous melody,
poured forth by one person, is altered, and perhaps
improved, by another, and so passes from mouth
to mouth till finally it becomes a possession of all
the people. Slavonic folk-songs differ greatly from
the Romance and Germanic; they are historical
records of the feelings, customs, and character of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">MAZOVIAN MUSICIANS.</span>
Chopin was born and bred in Mazovia, a peculiarly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
music-loving province. A distinguished Polish
writer<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> says: “The love of song characterizes the
Slavonic above all other races; the rudest peasant
could be allured to the end of the world by his
national songs.” The Mazovians have such an
intense love for music that they sing about the
commonest affairs of life, readily perceiving their
pleasing and touching phases. The predilection of
the Poles for these songs is often a matter of pecuniary
profit, for a beggar, with some talent in singing
and playing the violin, has no difficulty in obtaining
alms. During the great festivals—Easter, Whitsuntide,
and Christmas—men and women walk
about the Mazovian villages, singing and playing
appropriate dances, and everywhere they are warmly
received, gladly listened to, and not sparingly rewarded.
Nearly all these songs originated in the
cottage, their composers were men who could neither
read nor write, and whose names will always remain
unknown.</p>

<p>Poetical perception and sensibility to the beauties
of nature are evidently innate in the Polish character;
they are susceptibilities which neither prosaic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>work, the cares of daily life, nor even the burden
of more than a century of national suffering have
had power to blunt.</p>

<p>In his childhood Chopin had imbedded these
folk-songs in his memory, and, impressed by their
peculiar beauty, he frequently interwove some
especial favorite into his own compositions. He
first gave the national dance tune a truly beautiful
and perfect form by adorning it with interesting
harmonies and poetical arabesques.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">
<i>CHOPINʼS EARLY MANHOOD. HIS FIRST JOURNEY.
HIS RELATIONS WITH PRINCE ANTON
RADZIWILL.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 33px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="36" height="60" alt="T" /></span>HE year 1825 found Fredericʼs social and artistic
circle continually increasing in numbers and
influence, and the fame of his extraordinary musical
talents spreading far and wide. He excited universal
interest, and it is a proof of his popularity that the
only strikingly successful concerts were those in
which he took part. His marvellous playing at
two grand concerts, given for charitable objects,
in the hall of the Conservatoire, on May 27th, and
June 10th, 1825, awakened unbounded approbation.
As the best pianist in the capital, Chopin was
summoned to play before the Emperor, Alexander I.,
who, during his stay in Warsaw, was desirous of
hearing the newly-invented Aelomelodicon.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The
instrument was placed in the Protestant Church, for
the sake of heightening the tone by its being heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>under the enormous dome of that building. In
token of his admiration of the wonderful performance
of the talented youth, then little more than a
boy, the Emperor presented him with a valuable
diamond ring.</p>

<p>The same year saw the publication of Chopinʼs
first printed work, the Rondo dedicated to Madame
von Linde. Neither this nor the following “Rondo
à la Masur,” op. 5, also published in Warsaw, made
him famous abroad, but in his own city he was
already regarded as a popular and rapidly ripening
artist. Looking at their son merely as a distinguished
<i>dilettante</i>, his parents had not made music
his chief study, but when they saw that Frederic
was by nature designed for a great musician, they
removed all obstacles, and left him to the undisturbed
enjoyment of his piano and his poetic dreams.</p>

<p>Everywhere he was warmly welcomed: in the
drawing-rooms of the aristocracy, by his comrades at
the Conservatoire, or the Lyceum, of which he was
considered the highest ornament, and where he formed
some life-long friendships. Among these friends we
may mention Titus Woyciechowski, to whom he
dedicated his “Variations, op. 2;” Alexander Rembielinski;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Wilhelm von Kolberg; Johann Matuszynski,
Stanislas Kozmian, now President of the
Scientific Society at Posen; Eustachius Marylski;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Dominicus Magnuszewski and Stephan Witwicki,
both poets of talent; Celinski; Hube, and Julius
Fontana.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">NO JEALOUSY OF HIM AMONG HIS FELLOWS.</span>
Frederic excited no jealousy among his fellow
students at the Conservatoire, for his talents as
pianist and composer were so pre-eminent that they
all bowed before him as their master. Kind and
affable by disposition he had also an innate grace,
while, from his education and refined surroundings,
he possessed, even in early youth, the tact of a
grown-up person. These qualities won the esteem
and affection of all who knew him, and no one
was offended by his practical jokes, mimicries, or
caricatures.</p>

<p>The activity of the young artist was intense, and
although his excessive exertions appeared to him
but slight, they undoubtedly injured his delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>constitution. Fredericʼs parents having been advised
by the physicians to send their youngest daughter,
Emily, to Bad Reinerz, in Silesia, they thought it
well to let him accompany her that he might try the
whey cure. Accordingly, at the beginning of the
holidays of 1826, the mother, Louise, Emily, and
Frederic went to the then much frequented spring.
During their visit a poor widow, who had vainly
been seeking help from the healing stream, died,
leaving two young children, under the care of a
faithful nurse, but without sufficient means for the
funeral and the journey home. Hearing of their
need, Chopin made the noblest use of his talents.
He arranged a concert for the benefit of the poor
children, and had the satisfaction of obtaining a
good sum. By his masterly playing he won the
admiration of the connoisseurs; by his benevolence,
the esteem of all generous minds. He became the
object of the most courteous attention. A few
days after the concert Frederic and his family left
Reinerz, and spent the rest of the summer at the
village of Strzyzewo, part of the estate of his godmother,
Madame von Wiesiolowska, sister to Count
Skarbek.</p>

<p>Prince Anton Radziwill, a wealthy nobleman,
related to the Prussian Royal family, and Governor
of the Duchy of Posen, had his summer residence
in the neighbouring village, Antonin. A passionate
lover of music, a keen connoisseur, and a thoroughly
trained composer, he had obtained celebrity by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
music to the first part of Goetheʼs <i>Faust</i>, which, by
Royal command, was for several years performed
annually in his honour at the Berlin Academy for
Singing. He had a very agreeable tenor voice,
and also played the violoncello well. His house,
in Posen, was the <i>rendezvous</i> for the best artists,
and quartet parties for the performance of classical
music were held in his <i>salons</i> nearly every week, the
Prince himself playing the violoncello.</p>

<p>Frederic having availed himself of an invitation
to Antonin, the Prince took a great fancy to him,
and was charmed with his playing. In May, 1829,
when he went to Warsaw as representative of the
Prussian court, at the coronation of the Emperor
<span class="sidenote">VISITED BY PRINCE ANTON RADZIWILL.</span>
Nicholas, he visited Frederic at his fatherʼs house,
and was very pressing in inviting him to his establishment
at Posen. There was no further personal
intercourse between this magnate and our artist,
yet writers, ignorant of the facts, have represented
the Prince as Chopinʼs benefactor, and as having
supplied the means for his education. Franz Liszt
was the first to promulgate this error in his book,
entitled “Francois Chopin,” written in French,
shortly after the masterʼs death, in which he says,
“supplementing the limited means of the family,
the Prince bestowed on Frederic the inestimable
gift of a good and complete education. Through a
friend, M. Antoine Korzuchowski, the Prince, whose
own elevated mind enabled him to understand the
requirements of an artistic career, always paid his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
educational expenses. From this time until the
death of Chopin, M. Korzuchowski held the closest
relations of friendship with him.” In this statement
there is not a word of truth, yet it has been repeated
not only by foreign, but, what is less pardonable, even
by Polish authors.</p>

<p>We are fully aware that in the portions of the
work relating to Chopinʼs youth, manners, compositions,
and to the Polish national music, Liszt
received much help from a Polish emigrant, Franz
Grzymala. He had been a deputy at the Diet,
and was an able author and journalist; he died
in Paris in 1871, the day after the capitulation.
Not having made Chopinʼs acquaintance until his
residence in Paris, it does not appear, from what
he told Liszt, that he could have possessed any
accurate information about his early life. Julius
Fontana, who had known Chopin from childhood,
entered a protest against Lisztʼs assertion, so also
did the parents of the great artist, who were sadly
pained to read that Prince Radziwill had entirely
provided for Fredericʼs education. Professor at
three large academies in Warsaw, and proprietor
of a flourishing <i>pension</i>, surely Nicholas Chopin
would have found means for the education of his
dearly loved and only son.</p>

<p>An equally untrue report has been spread to the
effect that Chopin travelled to Italy at the expense
of Prince Radziwill. In reality the expenses of
the journey were defrayed by the receipts of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
numerously attended concerts given in Warsaw.
The first time he asked his father for money was
when he had determined on going to Paris, after a
sojourn of eighteen months in the beautiful Austrian
capital. In his charming, child-like manner, he
lamented that he should be the cause of additional
expenditure to his parents, to whom he had, he
thought, already cost quite enough. His father
sent him the money, and an affectionate letter, expressing
his willingness to supply him with means,
until he procured some regular mode of subsistence
in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DEDICATES HIS TRIO TO THE PRINCE.</span>
As a mark of friendship and respect for the distinguished
composer of the music to <i>Faust</i>, Frederic
dedicated to him his Trio, for pianoforte and violoncello,
op. 8, composed in Warsaw between 1827 and
1829; so that in point of fact Chopin, not the
Prince, was the donor. It is only fair to Liszt to
say that he is less to blame for the circulation of
the error we have pointed out, than Grzymala and
those who blindly believed and promulgated a statement
so utterly false.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>THE JOURNEY TO BERLIN. CHOPINʼS LETTERS.
AN INCIDENT OF THE RETURN TO WARSAW.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 33px;">
<img src="images/i.jpg" width="33" height="60" alt="I" /></span>N 1827 Chopin passed his final examination
before leaving the Lyceum, not, however, with
such brilliant success as on former occasions, when
every promotion to a higher class had been accompanied
by a special reward. This is accounted for
by his having, during the last year, devoted his
chief energies to music, a goodly pile of compositions,
finished or sketched in outline, being found in
his study. Elsner, who was the keenest observer
and most competent judge of Fredericʼs artistic
progress, and creative power, exhorted his parents
to let their son have his own way, and to do all they
could to encourage his lofty flights of fancy.</p>

<p>The question now was how to give the young
composer better opportunities for hearing and studying
than his native city afforded. Although first-rate
artists occasionally gave concerts in Warsaw,
Frederic could only satisfy his ardent desire of
hearing the sublime works of the classic masters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in the larger European centres of life and intelligence.
His parents, therefore, resolved to send
their beloved son to Vienna or Berlin, if only for
a few weeks, at the very first favourable opportunity.
One soon offered. In 1828, Professor Jarocki, having
been invited by Alexander von Humboldt to the
Naturalistsʼ Congress, at Berlin, Nicholas Chopin
was only too happy to confide his son to the care
of one of his best friends, while the Professor was
equally pleased to have the company of an amiable
and talented young man like Chopin.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">VISITS BERLIN.</span>
Thus he left his native land for the first time
to visit a large foreign city, where he hoped to learn
a great deal. Unconscious of his own artistic greatness
he had no wish to appear in Berlin as a pianist
or composer. An opportunity was offered him of
meeting Spontini, Zelter, and the youthful though
famous Felix Mendelssohn, but he did not venture
to present himself before these celebrated masters.
The physiognomies of the German <i>savants</i> seemed
odd to the young Pole, the French blood stirred in
his veins, and he could not refrain from caricaturing
these worthy but somewhat strange-looking gentlemen.</p>

<p>He was enraptured with the oratorio of Handelʼs,
which he heard at the Academy of Singing: never
had he received so deep an impression from church
music. The performance of <i>Der Freischütz</i>, with
which bewitching opera he had already become acquainted
in Warsaw, likewise gave him indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
delight, while he was much interested in comparing
the opera in that city with the Royal opera
in Berlin.</p>

<p>Since he left Warsaw the only time he touched
the piano was at a little village on his way back,
when he played at the request of the post master
and his travelling companions.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LETTER TO WOYCIECHOWSKY.</span>
We will now let our artist speak for himself, only
making such alterations as the necessities of translation
require.</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>To Titus Woyciechowsky.</i></p>

<p class="right">
<i>Warsaw, September 9th, 1828.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Titus</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>You cannot think how I have been longing
for news of you and your mother, nor imagine my
joy when I received your letter. I was then at
Strzyzewo, where I spent the whole summer, but
could not reply immediately because I was so busy
preparing to return to Warsaw. Now I am writing
like a lunatic, for I really do not know what I am
about. I am actually starting for Berlin to-day!
There is to be a philosophical congress at Berlin—after
the model of those held in Switzerland and
Bavaria—to which the King has requested the
University to invite the most celebrated European
naturalists. The president is to be the renowned
Alexander von Humboldt. Professor Jarocki has
received an invitation as a zoologist, and ex-student
and doctor of the Berlin University. Something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
magnificent is anticipated, and it is reported that
Spontini will give a performance of his “Cortez.”</p>

<p>Jarockiʼs friend and teacher, Lichtenstein, officiates
as secretary to the Congress: he is a member of the
Academy of Singing, and is on a friendly footing
with the director, Herr Zelter. I learn from a good
authority in Berlin that I shall have an opportunity,
through Lichtenstein, of becoming acquainted with
all the best musicians in the Prussian capital, except
Spontini, with whom he is not on good terms.</p>

<p>I shall be much pleased to meet the Prussian
Prince Radziwill, who is a friend of Spontini. I only
intend spending a fortnight with Jarocki, but this
will give me an opportunity of, at any rate, hearing
a good opera once, and so having an idea of a perfect
performance, which is worth a good deal of trouble.</p>

<p>At Strzyzewo I arranged my last Rondo in C
major, for two pianos.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>To-day I tried it with Ernemann, at Bucholtzʼs,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
and it came out pretty well. We intend to play it
some day at the “Ressource.”</p>

<p>As to new compositions I have nothing besides
the still unfinished Trio (G minor) which I began
after your departure. The first <i>Allegro</i> I have
already tried with accompaniments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>It seems to me that this Trio will meet the same
fate as the Sonata and Variations. Both are already
in Vienna; the former I have dedicated to Elsner, as
his pupil; to the latter I have—perhaps somewhat
presumptuously—affixed your name. I acted on the
impulse of affection, and I am sure you will not misconstrue
my motives. Skarbek has not yet returned,
Jedrzejewicz will remain some time longer in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> He was there introduced to the pianist
Sowinski,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> who wrote to me to say that he should
like to make my acquaintance, by correspondence,
before he comes to Warsaw. As he is assistant
editor of Fétisʼs <i>Revue Musicale</i>, he would be glad
to be informed about musical affairs in Poland, or
to receive biographies of the foremost Polish composers
and artists—matters in which I have not the
least intention of being mixed up, so I shall reply to
him from Berlin that what he wants is not at all in
my line, and that I do not feel competent to write
for a Paris journal, requiring able and matured
criticism.</p>

<p>At the end of this month I shall leave Berlin, a
five daysʼ journey by diligence!</p>

<p>Everything here is just the same as ever; the
excellent Zywny is the heart and soul of all our
parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>I must conclude, for my luggage is already packed
and sent to the diligence.</p>

<p>I kiss your motherʼs feet and hands. My parents
and sisters send kind regards and sincerest wishes
for the improvement of her health.</p>

<p>Take pity on me, and write soon, however briefly.
I shall value a single line.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FIRST LETTER FROM BERLIN TO HIS PARENTS.</span><br /><br /><br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="right"><i>Berlin, Tuesday.</i><a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p class="left"><span class="smcap">My dearly beloved Parents</span></p>
<p class="left padl3"><span class="smcap">and Sisters</span>,</p>

<p>We arrived safely in this great city about 3
oʼclock on Sunday afternoon, and went direct from
the post to the hotel “Zum Kronprinz,” where we
are now. It is a good and comfortable house. The
day we arrived Professor Jarocki took me to Herr
Lichtensteinʼs, where I met Alex. von Humboldt.
He is not above the middle height, and his features
cannot be called handsome, but the prominent, broad
brow, and the deep penetrating glance reveal the
searching intellect of the scholar, who is as great a
philanthropist as he is a traveller. He speaks
French like his mother tongue; even you would
have said so, dear Father.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>
<p>Herr Lichtenstein promised to introduce me to
the first musicians here; and regretted that we had
not arrived a few days sooner to have heard his
daughter perform at a <i>matinée</i>, last Sunday, with
orchestral accompaniments.</p>

<p>I, for my part, felt but little disappointment, but,
whether rightly or wrongly, I know not, for I have
neither seen nor heard the young lady. The day we
arrived there was a performance of “The Interrupted
Sacrifice,”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> but our visit to Herr Lichtenstein prevented
me from being present.</p>

<p>Yesterday the savants had a grand dinner; Herr
von Humboldt did not occupy the chair, but a very
different looking person, whose name I cannot at
this moment recall. However, as he is, no doubt,
some celebrity, I have written his name under my
portrait of him. (I could not refrain from making
some caricatures, which I have already classified.)
The dinner lasted so long that there was not time
for me to hear Birnbach, the much-praised violinist
of nine years. To-day I shall dine alone, having
made my excuses to Professor Jarocki, who readily
perceived that, to a musician, the performance of
such a work as Spontiniʼs “Ferdinand Cortez,”
must be more interesting than an interminable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
dinner among philosophers. Now I am quite alone,
and enjoying a chat with you, my dear ones.</p>

<p>There is a rumour that the great Paginini is
coming here. I only hope it is true. Prince
Radziwill is expected on the 20th of this month.
It will be a great pleasure to me if he comes. I
have, as yet, seen nothing but the Zoological
Cabinet, but I know the city pretty well, for I
wandered among the beautiful streets and bridges
for two whole days. You shall have a verbal
description of these, as, also, of the large and
<span class="sidenote">CONSIDERS BERLIN A STRAGGLING CITY.</span>
decidedly beautiful castle. The chief impression
Berlin makes upon me is that of a straggling city
which could, I think, contain double its present
large population. We wanted to have stayed in
the French street, but I am very glad we did not,
for it is as broad as our Lezno,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and needs ten
times as many people as are in it to take off its
desolate appearance.</p>

<p>To-day will be my first experience of the music of
Berlin. Do not think me one-sided, dearest Papa,
for saying that I would much rather have spent the
morning at Schlesingerʼs than in labouring through
the thirteen rooms of the Zoological Museum, but
I came here for the sake of my musical education,
and Schlesingerʼs library, containing, as it does, the
most important musical works of every age and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>country, is, of course, of more interest to me than
any other collection. I console myself with the
thought that I shall not miss Schlesingerʼs, and that
a young man ought to see all he can, as there is
something to be learnt everywhere. This morning
I went to Kistingʼs pianoforte manufactory, at the
end of the long Frederic Street, but as there was
not a single instrument completed, I had my long
walk in vain. Fortunately for me there is a good
grand piano in our hotel, which I play on every day,
both to my own and the landlordʼs gratification.</p>

<p>The Prussian diligences are most uncomfortable,
so the journey was less agreeable than I had
anticipated; however, I reached the capital of the
Hohenzollerns in good health and spirits. Our
travelling companions were a German lawyer, living
at Posen, who tried to distinguish himself by making
coarse jokes; and a very fat farmer, with a smattering
of politeness acquired by travelling.</p>

<p>At the last stage before Frankfort-on-the-Oder,
a German Sappho entered the diligence and poured
forth a torrent of ridiculous, egotistical complaints.
Quite unwittingly, the good lady amused me immensely,
for it was as good as a comedy, when she
began to argue with the lawyer, who, instead of
laughing at her, seriously controverted everything
she said.</p>

<p>The suburbs of Berlin, on the side by which we
approached are not pretty, but the scrupulous cleanliness
and order which everywhere prevail are very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
pleasing to the eye. To-morrow I shall visit the
suburbs on the other side.</p>

<p>The Congress will commence its sittings the day
after to-morrow, and Herr Lichtenstein has promised
me a ticket. In the evening Alex. von Humboldt
will receive the members at his house: Professor
Jarocki offered to procure me an invitation, but I
thanked him and said I should gain little, if any,
intellectual advantage from such a gathering, for
which I was not learned enough; besides the professional
gentlemen might cast questioning glances
at a layman like me, and ask, “Is Saul then among
the prophets?” I fancied, even at the dinner, that my
neighbour, Professor Lehmann, a celebrated botanist
from Hamburg, looked at me rather curiously. I
was astonished at the strength of his small fist; he
broke with ease the large piece of white bread, to
divide which I was fain to use both hands and a knife.
He leaned over the table to talk to Professor Jarocki,
and in the excitement of the conversation mistook his
<span class="sidenote">“A REAL SAVANT.”</span>
own plate and began to drum upon mine. A real
<i>savant</i>, was he not? with the great ungainly nose,
too. All this time I was on thorns, and as soon as he
had finished with my plate, I wiped off the marks of
his fingers with my serviette as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Marylski cannot have an atom of taste if he thinks
the Berlin ladies dress well; their clothes are handsome,
no doubt, but alas for the beautiful stuffs cut
up for such puppets!</p>

<i>Berlin, September 20th, 1828.</i>
</p>

<p>I am well and happy, dear Parents and Sisters.
As if on purpose to honour me, a fresh piece is
brought out at the theatre every day. First I heard
an oratorio at the Academy of Singing; then at
the Opera, “Ferdinand Cortez,” “Il Matrimonio
Segreto,” and Onslowʼs<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> “Der Hausirer.” I greatly
enjoyed all these performances, but I must confess
that I was quite carried away by Handelʼs “Ode on
St. Ceciliaʼs Day;” this most nearly approaches
my ideal of sublime music. With the exception of
Signora Tibaldi (alto), and Fräulein von Schätzel,
whom I heard in “Der Hausirer,” and at the
Academy of Singing, all the best singers are away.
Fräulein von Schätzel pleased me best in the
Oratorio, but it may have been that I was in
a better mood that evening for listening. The
Oratorio, however, was not without a “but,” which,
perhaps, will only be got rid of in Paris.</p>

<p>I have not called on Herr Lichtenstein yet, for he
is so busy with preparations for the Congress, that
even Professor Jarocki can scarcely get a word with
him, but he has kindly procured me a ticket of
admission. I was in such a capital place that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
could see and hear everything, and was quite close
to the Crown Prince. Spontini, Zelter, and Felix
Mendelssohn Bartholdy were also there; but I did
not speak to any of them, as I did not think it proper
to introduce myself. It is said that Prince Radziwill
will come to-day; I shall find out after breakfast if
this is really true.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">BARON VON HUMBOLDT.</span>
At the Singing Academy I observed the handsome
Princess von Liegnitz, talking to a man in a kind of
livery, whose face I could not clearly see. I asked
my neighbour if he were a Royal valet de chambre,
and received for a reply, “Aye, that is His Excellency
Baron von Humboldt.” You may imagine, my dear
ones, how thankful I was that I had only uttered
my question in a whisper; but I assure you that the
chamberlainʼs uniform changes even the countenance,
or I could not have failed to recognise the great
traveller, who has ascended the mighty Chimborazo.
Yesterday he was present at the performance of
“Der Hausirer,” or, as the French call it, “Le
Colporteur.” In the Royal box sat Prince Charles.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday we visited the Royal
library, which is very large, but does not contain
many musical works. I was much interested in
seeing an autograph letter of Kosciuskoʼs, which his
biographer, Falkenstein, immediately copied, letter
by letter. When he saw that we were Poles, and
could, therefore, read the letter without any trouble,
he begged Professor Jarocki to translate it into
German, while he wrote it down in his pocket book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Falkenstein, an agreeable young man, is secretary to
the Dresden Library. I met, also, the editor of the
<i>Berlin Musical Gazette</i>; we were introduced, and
exchanged a few words. To-morrow will see the
fulfilment of one of my most earnest wishes: “Der
Freischutz” is to be performed. I shall then be
able to compare our singers with the singers here.
To-day I am invited to the grand dinner at the drill
house. The number of caricatures increases.</p>

<p>I am quite well, and have seen all that is to be

from the day after to-morrow, we shall embrace.
Lounging about agrees with me capitally. Yesterday
“The Interrupted Sacrifice” was performed again,
and Fräulein von Schätzel omitted more than one
chromatic scale. I quite fancied myself in your

<span class="sidenote">DINING WITH THE NATURALISTS.</span>
here the second dinner with the naturalists, which
took place the day before the conclusion of the
Congress, and was really very lively and entertaining.
Several very fair convivial songs were sung, in
which all the company joined more or less heartily.
Zelter conducted, and a large golden cup, standing
on a red pedestal, in front of him, as a sign of his
exalted musical merits, appeared to give him much
satisfaction. The dishes were better that day than
usual, they say, “because the naturalists have been
principally occupied during their sittings with the
improvement of meats, sauces, soups, &amp;c.” They
make fun of these learned gentlemen in like manner
at the Königstadt Theatre. In a play, in which
some beer is drunk, one asks, “Why is beer so good
now in Berlin?” “Why, because the naturalists
are holding their conference,” is the answer.</p>

<p>But it is time to go to bed, as we start off quite
early to-morrow. We shall spend two days at

you again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Jarocki and Chopin had, as companions,
on their return from Berlin, two gentlemen, whose
wearisome talk about politics, in which Chopin never
took any interest, and still more their incessant smoking,
(almost unendurable to Chopin) made them very
disagreeable. When one of the gentlemen announced
that he should smoke till he went to sleep, and
would rather die than give up his pipe, Frederic and
the Professor went outside the diligence to enjoy the
fresh air.</p>

<p>At the little town of Züllichau, finding they had
an hour to wait for horses, Professor Jarocki proposed
a walk through the place. This did not take
long, and as the horses were not ready when they
returned, the Professor sat down to a meal—the
post-house being also a restaurant—but Frederic, as
if drawn by a magnet, went into the next room, and
saw—oh, wonder of wonders!—a grand piano.
Professor Jarocki, who could see through the open
door, laughed to himself when his young friend
opened the instrument, which had a very unpromising
exterior; Chopin also looked at it with some
misgivings; but when he had struck a few chords he
exclaimed, in joyful surprise, “O Santa Cæcilia, the
piano is in tune.”</p>

<p>Only the impassioned musician knows what it is,
after sitting for several days in a diligence, suddenly,
and quite unexpectedly, to have an opportunity of
playing on a good instrument.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PLAYING AT A POST-HOUSE.</span>
Regardless of his surroundings our artist began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
improvise <i>con amore</i>. Attracted by the music, one of
the travellers got up and stood behind the playerʼs
chair. Chopin called out to Professor Jarocki, in
Polish, “Now we shall see whether my listener be a
connoisseur or not.” Frederic began his Fantasia on
Polish Songs (op. 13); the traveller, a German,
stood like one petrified, captivated by this music, so
new and bewitching; his eyes mechanically followed
every movement of the pianistʼs delicate hand; he
had forgotten everything, even his beloved pipe,
which went out unheeded. The other travellers
stepped in softly, and at the same time the tall postmaster
and his buxom wife appeared at the side
door with their two pretty daughters behind them.
Frederic, unmindful of his audience, and absorbed in
converse with his muse, had lost all thought of where
he was, and that he must soon be on his way.</p>

<p>More and more tender and graceful became his
playing; the fairies seemed to be singing their moon-light
melodies; everyone was listening in rapt
attention to the elegant arabesques sparkling from
his fingers, when a stentorian voice, which made the
windows rattle, called out, “The horses are ready,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Confounded disturber,” roared the postmaster,
while the triplet of ladies cast angry glances at the
postilion. Chopin sprang from his seat, but was
immediately surrounded by his audience, who exclaimed
with one voice: “Go on, dear sir, finish
that glorious piece, which we should have heard all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
through but for that tiresome man.” “But,” replied
Chopin, consulting his watch, “we have already been
here some hours, and are due in Posen shortly.”</p>

<p>“Stay and play, noble young artist,” cried the
postmaster, “I will give you couriersʼ horses if you
will only remain a little longer.”</p>

<p>“Do be persuaded,” began the postmasterʼs wife,
almost threatening him with an embrace. What
could Frederic do but sit down again to the
instrument?</p>

<p>When he paused the servant appeared with wine
and glasses; the daughters of the host served the
artist first, then the other travellers, while the postmaster
gave a cheer for the “darling Polyhymnias,”
as he expressed it, in which all united. One of the
company (probably the town cantor) went close up
to Chopin and said, in a voice trembling with
emotion, “Sir, I am an old and thoroughly trained
musician; I, too, play the piano, and so know how
to appreciate your masterly performance; if Mozart
had heard it he would have grasped your hand and
cried, ‘Bravo.’ An insignificant old man like myself
cannot dare to do so.”</p>

<p>The women, in their gratitude, filled the pockets
of the carriage with the best eatables that the house
contained, not forgetting some good wine. The
postmaster exclaimed, with tears of joy, “As long as
I live I shall think, with enthusiasm, of Frederic
Chopin.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CARRIED TO HIS CARRIAGE.</span>
When, after playing one more Mazurka, Frederic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
prepared to go, his gigantic host seized him in his
arms, and carried him to the carriage.</p>

<p>The postilion, still sulky over his scolding, and
jealous because the pretty servant girl could not take
her eyes off the interesting <i>virtuoso</i>, whispered to
her, “Things often go very unfairly in the world.
The young gentleman is carried into the carriage by
the master himself; the like of us must climb
laboriously on to the box by ourselves, though we
are musical.”</p>

<p>Long years afterwards Chopin would recall this
episode with pleasure. It was like a good omen to
him at the commencement of his artistic career.
He often related how, like the old minstrels who
went from town to town with their harps and
received good cheer as their honorarium, he had
played at Züllichau for cakes, fruit, and good wine;
and assured his most intimate friends that the
highest praise lavished on him by the press had
never given him more pleasure than the naïve
homage of the German who, in his eagerness to
hear, let his pipe go out.</p>

<p>At Posen our travellers visited, by invitation, the
Archbishop Wolicki, and paid their respects to
Prince A. Radziwill. They both met with the
kindest reception from the Prince, who knew how
to esteem such a learned man as Jarocki, but, being
a musician to the backbone, he was better able to
appreciate the eminent talents of Chopin; he regarded
him as a kindred spirit, whose superiority he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
gladly recognized. Most of the day was devoted
to music; the sonatas of Mozart, Beethoven, and
Hummel were performed by Chopin and the bandmaster,
Klinghor. But Frederic called forth most
admiration by his incomparable improvisation.</p>

<p>As soon as they had left Posen, Fredericʼs ardent
yearning to see his family impelled him to his
fatherʼs house, and his love of art summoned him
back to his studies. The last miles seemed endless,
and, yielding to his pressing request, the Professor
decided to take post horses at Lowicz.</p>

<p>On October 6th Frederic reached at length his
much desired goal. His eyes, sparkling with
pleasure, rested on the towers of Warsaw, the
nimble horses flew along the street, the coach
stopped at the door, there were loud cries of joy,
and the dear returning one was in the loving arms of
his parents and sisters.<br /><br /></p>

<i>JOURNEY TO VIENNA, PRAGUE, TEPLITZ,

CONCERTS IN VIENNA.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 35px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="35" height="60" alt="F" /></span>REDERIC studied with indefatigable zeal from
one yearʼs end to another; neither father nor
teacher had ever been obliged to incite him to diligence,
for even as a mere boy he had always shown
a great desire for knowledge. But when the time
approached for him to pass his final musical examination
before a small critical circle, he worked
almost beyond his strength. His anxious father,
therefore, resolved to send him on another journey,
having made the happy discovery that his Frederic
had learned a great deal in Berlin.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>
<p>This time (July, 1829) our artist was to go to
Vienna with some young friends, and he was highly
delighted at the prospect, although his father and
all his friends urged him to appear publicly as a
pianist in that musical city.</p>

<p>With the innate modesty which never left him
even after his greatest triumphs, he exclaimed,
“Here I have been leniently judged by kind-hearted
compatriots; but what am I to expect in a city
which can boast of having heard a Haydn, a
Mozart, and a Beethoven?”</p>

<p>A few months before this journey Frederic had
become acquainted with Hummel, who had stayed
some time in Warsaw, and given concerts there.
Hummel<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> had acquired, by his very successful tour,
the reputation of being the greatest living pianist.
Chopin was acquainted with his compositions, and
thought very highly of them. He greatly admired
his classical style of playing, formed on the best
models; yet, exacting as the young artist was
towards himself, he could say, without vanity, that,
in technical execution, he was not very inferior to
the older master.</p>

<p>Fredericʼs chief desire was to become acquainted
with the beautiful, musical Vienna, to hear all he
could that was new to him, and, if possible, to have
intercourse with the masters of his art. He never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
dreamt that the latter, dazzled by his extraordinary
genius, would be the very people who would press
him to appear in public.</p>

<p>With a heart full of hope for himself and fervent
blessings for his family, Chopin, in company with
his friends Celinski, Hube, and Franz Maciejowski
(the last named a nephew of the famous investigator
of Slavonic law), left his beloved Warsaw.</p>

<p>After visiting Cracow, the old capital of the Piasts
and the Jagellons and Ojcow, the so-called Polish
Switzerland, the travellers arrived on July 31st at
Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FIRST LETTER FROM VIENNA.</span>
The following is a faithful transcription of the
letters Chopin wrote from that city:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">

<i>Vienna, August 1st, 1829.</i></p>

<p class="left"><span class="smcap">My dearly loved Parents</span></p>
<p class="left padl3"><span class="smcap">and Sisters</span>,</p>

<p>We arrived here yesterday well and in good spirits,
and I may say without fatigue, and so without discomfort.
We took a private carriage at Cracow, in
which we were very comfortable. We were able to
enjoy to perfection the picturesque scenery of Galicia,
Upper Silesia, and Moravia, for the clouds had been
amiable enough to lay the dust with a slight shower.</p>

<p>But before I speak of Vienna I must tell you
about our journey to Ojcow. On Sunday afternoon
we hired a four-horse country waggon, such as they
use at Cracow, which cost us four thalers. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>dashed merrily and swiftly along to Ojcow, intending
to put up at Herr Indykʼs house, which all
tourists praise, and where Fräulein Tanska<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> stayed.
But, as ill-luck would have it, Herr Indyk lived a
full mile outside the town; our coachman did not
know the way, and drove us into a little brook, as
clear and silvery as those in the fairy tales. Right
and left were walls of rock, and we did not find our
way out of the labyrinth till nearly 9 oʼclock, when
two passing peasants good naturedly conducted us
to Herr Indykʼs. Wearied and wet through, we at
length reached the wished for house, and were very
kindly received. Although not expecting visitors at
so late an hour, Herr Indyk made no trouble about
giving us a room in the little house, built on purpose
for tourists. Sister Isabella<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Fräulein Tanska had
been in it only a little while before.</p>

<p>My companions changed their clothes and gathered
round the stove, in which our host had, meanwhile,
lighted a fire. Wet above the knees, I crouched in
a corner, considering what I had best do. Seeing
the mistress go into the next room for linen for our
beds, I instinctively followed her, and finding on the
table a pile of woollen Cracow caps (they are double
woven), I bought one, tore it in half, wrapped my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
feet in it, sat before the fire and drank a small glass
of red wine. I thus escaped a severe cold. We
laughed and talked a little while over our adventure,
then went to bed and slept soundly.</p></blockquote>

<hr />
<p>Frederic, who had a sharp eye and a keen ear for
all around him, goes on to describe the neighbourhood
of Ojcow, the strangely-formed sand rocks, the
black grotto, and the Kingʼs grotto, in which tradition
says, that King Lokietek<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> took refuge from
<span class="sidenote">CHARMED WITH CRACOW.</span>
his enemies, at the end of the 13th century. Frederic
was very enthusiastic over everything he saw, but
Cracow and the neighbourhood appear to have had a
special charm for him. He gives an account, also,
of the Vienna picture gallery, to which he had at
first only paid a flying visit. We give, unabridged,
the following letters to his family:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">
<i>Vienna, August 8th, 1829.</i>
</p>

<p>I am well and in good spirits. Why, I do not
know, but the people here are astonished at me, and
I wonder at them for finding anything to wonder at
in me. I am indebted to good Elsnerʼs letter of
recommendation for my exceedingly friendly reception
by Herr Haslinger. He did not know how to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>make me sufficiently welcome; he showed me all
the musical novelties he had, made his son play to
me, and apologized for not introducing his wife, who
had just gone out. In spite of all his politeness he
has not yet printed my compositions. I did not ask
him about them, but he said, when showing me one
of his finest editions, that my Variations were to
appear, next week, in the same style, in <i>Odeon</i>.
This I certainly had not expected.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> He strongly
advised me to play in public, although it is
summer, and, therefore, not a favourable time for
concerts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PRESSED BY FRIENDS TO PERFORM.</span>
The artists and lovers of music, who know that I
am here, consider that Vienna would lose a great
deal if I left without giving a concert. I do not
know what to make of it all; Schuppanzigh, to
whom I have letters of recommendation, informs me
that although his quartet parties are over, he will
try to get a gathering before I leave. I have only
been once to Herr Hussarzewski; he was quite
enthusiastic about my playing, and invited me to
dinner. Several Viennese gentlemen were present,
and all, without exception, as if by previous concert,
recommended me to perform in public.</p>

<p>Stein offered to send me one of his instruments,
and begged me to play on it at my concert; Graff,
whose pianos I prefer, has made the same proposal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Würfel<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> says that if you have composed anything
new, and want it to create a sensation, you must,
by all means, play it yourself. Herr Blahetka, a
journalist, whom I met at Haslingerʼs, also advised
me to give a concert. My Variations have been
much praised by those who have heard them.</p>

<p>I have also made the acquaintance of Count
Gallenberg, who is manager of a theatre, where
I have heard some second-rate concerts. Haslinger
thinks that the Viennese should hear me play my
own compositions. Everybody assures me that the
newspapers will be sure to give me a flattering
notice. Würfel is of opinion that, as my compositions
are to appear now, it would be advisable for me to
give a concert, otherwise I should have to come
again, but that the present would be the best time,
as the Viennese are longing for something new. He
calls it unpardonable in a young musician to neglect
such an opportunity; I ought to appear in the twofold
capacity of pianist and composer, and must not
think too modestly of myself. He wishes me to play
the Variations first, then the Rondo Cracovienne,
and, in conclusion, to improvise.</p>

<p>I do not know yet how it will all be arranged.
Stein is very kind and amiable, but I should prefer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>to use one of Graffʼs instruments. Haslinger,
Blahetka and Würfel approve my choice.</p>

<p>Wherever I show myself, I am besieged with
requests to play. I have no lack of acquaintances
in the musical world, and Haslinger is going to
introduce me to Charles Czerny. Up till now I
have heard three operas, “La Dame Blanche,”
“Cenerentola,” and Meyerbeerʼs “Crociato.” Orchestra
and chorus were excellent. To-day “Joseph
in Egypt” is to be performed. I have twice listened,
with admiration, to Maysederʼs solos at the Academy
of Music.</p>

<p>Vienna is handsome, lively, and pleases me exceedingly.
They are trying to persuade me to spend
the winter here. Würfel has just come in to take
me to Haslingerʼs.</p>

<p>P.S.—I have made up my mind. Blahetka thinks
I shall make a <i>furore</i>, for, as he puts it, I am “an
artist of the first rank and worthy to be placed beside
Moscheles, Herz, and Kalkbrenner.” Würfel is
really very kind, and has introduced me to Count
Gallenberg; the bandmaster, Seyfried, and others
of his influential acquaintances, and those who are
<span class="sidenote">ARRANGEMENTS FOR A CONCERT.</span>
interested in music. He declares I shall not leave
Vienna till I have given a concert. Count Gallenberg
is very pleased with this, as I shall play at his
theatre, and—as my principal object now is to win
laurels—without payment. The journalists stare at
me already; the members of the orchestra salute
me quite obsequiously when I walk in, arm in arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
with the director of the Italian opera (which is
now closed.)</p>

<p>Würfel has taken no end of trouble on my behalf,
and will be present at the rehearsal. He was very
kind to me at Warsaw, and I am particularly glad
that he has such a pleasant recollection of Elsner.
People here are surprised that Kessler, Ernemann,
and Czapeck should live in Warsaw with me there
too, but I tell them that I give no lessons and only
play from love of art. I have decided on Graffʼs
instrument, but I do not want to offend Stein, so I
shall thank him with such an expression of obligation
that he cannot but forgive me.</p>

<p>I hope for Godʼs gracious help. Do not be anxious,
my dearest ones.</p>

<p class="right padr2">
Your fondly loving</p>

<i>Vienna, Wednesday, August 12th, 1829.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FIRST CONCERT IN VIENNA.</span>
You know of my intention, my beloved ones, from
my last letter. Yesterday (Tuesday) at 7 oʼclock
in the evening, I appeared before a Viennese public
for the first time, at the Imperial Opera House.
Here, an evening concert in the theatre is called a
musical academy. As I played gratuitously, Count
Gallenberg expedited the arrangements for my
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>The following was the programme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Overture, by Beethoven</div>
<div class="line">My Variations.</div>
<div class="line">Song, by Fräulein Veltheim.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></div>
<div class="line">My Cracovienne.</div>
<div class="line">A Ballet, in conclusion.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The orchestra accompanied so badly at the rehearsal
that I was obliged to substitute a “Free
Fantasia” for the Rondo.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ENTHUSIASTIC RECEPTION.</span>
Directly I appeared I was greeted with cries of
“Bravo,” and, after each variation, the audience
shouted this welcome word so lustily that I could
not hear the <i>tutti</i> of the orchestra. I had such a
hearty recall, that I was obliged to come forward
twice to bow my acknowledgments. I must confess
that I was not quite satisfied myself with the free
fantasia; but the public must have been pleased, for
I was overwhelmed with applause. One reason for
this may have been that the Germans know how to
appreciate free improvisation. I am now doubly
obliged to Würfel, for without his support and
encouragement I should never have accomplished
the daring stroke which has succeeded so well.
I shall be able to relate my experiences and
impressions by word of mouth better than I can now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
I was not hissed, so donʼt be uneasy about my
artistic reputation. The newspapers have been very
favourable to me; if some of them should pick holes
in me I am prepared for it. My compositions have
received Count Gallenbergʼs undivided approbation.
The theatrical manager, Herr Demar, was very
kind and pleasant; he did his best to encourage me
before I appeared, so I went to my piano without
much anxiety.</p>

<p>My friends were scattered about that they might
hear the observations of the critics, and the various
opinions of the public. Celinski can tell you that he
heard nothing unfavourable. Hube reports the most
severe criticism, and that, too, from a lady: “A pity
the youth has so little presence.” If this is the only
sort of blame I am to receive I cannot complain.
My friends swear they heard nothing but praise, and
that, until the spontaneous outburst of applause, not
one of them had clapped or uttered a bravo. The
manager was so pleased with my Rondo that he
came up after the concert, shook hands with me, and
made some very flattering remarks.</p>

<p>I improvised from “La Dame Blanche,” and, that
I might have a Polish theme, chose “Chmiel.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The
public, to whom this kind of national melody is
quite unknown, seemed electrified. My spies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>pit say the people began a regular dance on the
benches.</p>

<p>Wertheim, although only arriving yesterday with
his wife from Carlsbad, went to the theatre;
he could not imagine how I came to play there.
He was here just now to congratulate me on my
good success. At Carlsbad he saw Hummel who
remembered me very kindly. He writes to him
to-day, and will inform him of my performance.</p>

<p>Haslinger is to print my works; I have kept the
programme of the concert. It was most interesting
to me to become personally acquainted with
Gyrowetz, Lachner, Kreutzer, and Seyfried; with
Mayseder I have had a very long conversation.
There is an almost unanimous opinion that I play
too softly, or rather, too delicately for the public
here. That is to say, they are accustomed to the
drum beating of their own Piano <i>virtuosi</i>. I am
afraid the newspapers will say the same thing,
especially as the daughter of one of the editors drums
dreadfully; but never mind, if it is to be so, I would
much rather they said I played too gently than too
roughly.</p>

<p>Count Dietrichstein, one of the personages nearest
to the Emperor, came on to the stage yesterday,
and had a long talk with me in French,
complimented me and requested me to stay longer
in Vienna.</p>

<p>The Orchestra execrated my badly written score,
and were not at all favourable to me up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
moment of my improvisation; then, in concert with
the public, they applauded heartily, which showed
their good opinion of me. I do not know yet what
the other artists think; but why should they
especially be against me? They see that I do
not play for pecuniary advantage.</p>

<p>So my first performance, unexpected as it was, has
passed off successfully. Hube thinks that one never
succeeds in anything by ordinary means and according
to preconceived plans, but must trust somewhat
to chance. So I trusted to my good fortune
and allowed myself to be persuaded to give the
concert. If the newspapers cut me up so much that
I shall not venture before the world again, I have
resolved to become a house painter; that would be
as easy as anything else, and I should, at any rate,
still be an artist!</p>

<p>I am curious to hear what Herr Elsner will say to
all this. Perhaps he disapproves of my playing at
all? But I was so besieged on all sides that I had
no escape, and I do not seem to have committed a
blunder by my performance.</p>

<p>Nidecki<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> was particularly friendly to me yesterday;
he looked through and corrected the orchestral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
parts, and was sincerely pleased at the applause I
received. I played on one of Graffʼs pianos. I am
at least four years wiser and more experienced.</p>

<p>You must, indeed, have wondered at my sealing
my last letter with a strange seal. I was absent-minded
and took the first and best that came to
hand.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p class="right padb05"><i>Thursday, August 13th, 1829.</i>
</p>

<p>If ever I longed to be with you I do so now.</p>

<p>To-day I have become acquainted with Count
Lichnowski. He did not know how to praise me
enough, he was so delighted with my playing.
Würfel took me to him. He was Beethovenʼs best
friend, to whom the great master was much indebted.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PROPOSALS FOR A SECOND CONCERT.</span>
Everyone says that I have especially pleased the
<i>noblesse</i> here. The Schwarzenbergʼs, Wrbnaʼs, and
others were quite enthusiastic about the delicacy and
elegance of my execution; in proof of this take
Count Dietrichsteinʼs coming on the stage to me.
Countess Lichnowski and her daughter, with whom
I drank tea to-day, are quite delighted that I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
going to give a second concert on Tuesday. They
invited me to visit them if I passed through Vienna,
on my way to Paris, then they wished to give me
a letter to a certain Countess, sister to Count
Lichnowski. A great deal too much kindness.
Czerny, Schuppanzigh, and Gyrowtez have also
paid me many compliments.</p>

<p>To-day a stranger looked at me in the ante-room,
and, asking Celinski if I was Chopin, rushed up to
me. He spoke of the pleasure he should have in
becoming acquainted with such an artist, and said,
“You really delighted and enchanted me the day
before yesterday.” It was the same gentleman who
had sat beside Maciejowski and seemed so delighted
with my improvisation on “Chmiel.”</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will I give a third concert;
I only give a second because I am forced to, and I
thought that people might say in Warsaw, “He only
gave <i>one</i> concert in Vienna, probably he was not
much liked.” To-day I was at the house of one of
the newspaper critics, who is very well disposed
towards me, and is sure to write a favourable
critique. I cannot tell you how kind and pleasant
Würfel is. I shall play gratuitously the second
time also, for the sake of obliging Gallenberg, whose
finances are not very flourishing. (But this is a
secret.) I shall play the Rondo, and then improvise.
For the rest, I am in good health, and eat and drink
well. Vienna pleases me much, and I am not without
the society of my countrymen; there is one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the ballet, who took charge of me at my <i>débût</i>, and
brought me <i>eau sucrée</i>.</p>

<p>Please relate all I write to Elsner, and beg him to
pardon me for not writing to him, but my time is
really so filled up that I have not a moment to spare.
I wish to thank M. Skarbek, who was one of the
foremost in persuading me to give a concert; and
this is, indeed, the artistʼs first step in life.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right padb05">
<i>Vienna, August 19th, 1829.</i></p>

<p>If on the first occasion the public were favourable,
my reception, yesterday, was still more hearty. I
was greeted, when I came on to the stage with three
long rounds of applause. The financial manager—whose
name I cannot remember—thanked me for
the receipts, and said that the house could not have
been so full on account of the ballet, for that had
been given several times.</p>

<p>The profession praise my Rondo, one and all,
from the bandmaster, Lachner, to the piano-tuner.
I know I have pleased the ladies and the musicians.
Gyrowetz, who sat next Celinski, called, “Bravo,”
and made a tremendous noise. The only people not
satisfied were the out-and-out Germans. Yesterday,
one of them, who had just come from the theatre,
sat down to eat at the table I was sitting at.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
His acquaintances asked him how he liked the performance.
“The ballet is pretty,” was his answer.
“But the concert, what of that?” they asked.
Instead of replying he began to talk of something
else, from which I conclude that he recognized me,
although my back was towards him. I felt bound to
relieve him from the restraint of my presence, and
went to bed, saying to myself, “The man has not
been born yet who does everything right.”<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">POPULARITY IN VIENNA.</span>
I am glad to be able to say that my popularity
increases. As I depart at 9 oʼclock this evening, I
must spend all the forenoon in farewell visits.
Schuppanzigh said, yesterday, that as I was leaving
Vienna so quickly, I must come again soon. I
answered that I should gladly return for the sake
of further improving myself, to which the Baron
replied, “that for such a reason I should never need
to come, for I had nothing more to learn.” This
opinion was confirmed by the others. These are,
indeed, mere compliments, but one does not listen to
them unwillingly. For the future I shall at any
rate not be regarded as a student.</p>

<p>Blahetka tells me that what he most wonders at
is that I could learn it all in Warsaw. I answered
that the greatest donkey must learn something with
Messrs. Zwyny and Elsner.</p>

<p>It is very unfortunate for me that I cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>confirm what I have told you by sending you the
opinions in the press. I know that the critique is
in the hands of the Editor of the paper to which
I have subscribed, and which Bäuerle<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> will send
to Warsaw. I expect they waited for my second
performance before giving a notice. This paper
comes out twice a week, Tuesdays and Saturdays,
possibly therefore you may read what is favourable
or the contrary about me before I do.</p>

<p>I have on my side the learned, and those who have
poetic temperaments. We shall have a great deal
to talk over. I would have written of something
quite different, but my head is so full of yesterday
that it is quite impossible to collect my thoughts.
My finances are still in the best order.</p>

<p>I have just paid my farewell visit to Schuppanzigh
and Czerny. Czerny was warmer than any of his
compositions. I have packed up, but must go again
to Haslingerʼs, and then to the café opposite the
theatre, where I am to meet Gyrowetz, Lachner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Kreutzer, Seyfried, and others. In two nights and a
day we shall be at Prague; the mail coach goes at
nine. It will be an agreeable journey with such
pleasant companions.</p>

<hr />
<p class="right"><i>Prague, Saturday, August 22nd, 1829.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM VIENNA.</span>After an affecting parting, which indeed it was, for
Fräulein Blahetka<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> gave me as a souvenir, a copy
of her compositions, with her autograph, and united
with her father in sending warmest regards to you
my good Papa, and to you my dear Mamma, with
congratulations to you both on having such a son;
young Stein wept, and Schuppanzigh, Gyrowetz,
in short all the artists were deeply moved: after
this tender farewell, and giving a promise of returning
soon, I got into the diligence. Nidecki and two
other Poles, who were to start for Trieste in half an
hour, accompanied us a little way. One of them,
Niegolewski by name, comes from Great Poland, and
is travelling with his tutor, or rather, companion,
a student from the Warsaw University; we had met
and conversed several times in Vienna.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<p>Countess Hussarzweska (she and her husband are
both excellent people) wanted to keep me to dinner
when I paid my farewell visit, but I had not time to
stay, having to go to Haslingerʼs. After many hearty
wishes for a speedy meeting, Haslinger promised,
most solemnly, to bring out my variations in five
weeks, that he may have something new to offer
the musical world in the autumn. Although a
stranger to you, my dear Father, he wished to be
kindly remembered.</p>

<p>When we were taking our places in the coach, a
young German got in, and, as we were to sit together
for two nights and a day, we scraped an acquaintance.
He was a merchant from Danzig, knew Pruszaka,
Sierakowski, of Waplew, Jaurek, Ernemann, Gresser,
and others. He was in Warsaw two years ago,
and had now just come from Paris. His name is
Normann. He was a very agreeable gentleman
and a capital travelling companion. We are in the
same hotel with him, and have resolved, when we
have seen Prague, to go on together to Teplitz and
Dresden. It would be inexcusable to miss seeing
Dresden when we are so near, especially as our
finances will permit of it, and the journey for four
persons is easily managed, and not expensive.</p>

<p>After a good shaking in the coach, we reached
Prague at noon, yesterday, and went at once to
<i>table-dʼhôte</i>. Then we called upon Hanka,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Maciejowski had a letter of introduction; I regretted
afterwards that I had not asked Skarbek to furnish
me with one to this famous savant. As we had
stayed some time at the Cathedral and Castle we
did not find Hanka at home.</p>

<p>The town, viewed from the castle hill, is large and
old-fashioned, but handsome in the general; formerly
it was an important place.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>Before leaving Vienna I had six letters given me,
five from Würfel and one from Blahetka, to Pixis,
asking him to show me the Conservatoire here.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">REQUESTED TO PLAY IN PRAGUE.</span>
They wanted me to play; but I shall only stay
three days, and I have no desire to forfeit the renown
I won in Vienna. As Paganini even was sharply
criticised, I shall take care not to perform in this
place. The five letters from Würfel are to the
Theatre director, the bandmaster, and other musical
celebrities. I shall deliver the letters, for he asked
me to very earnestly; but I will not perform. The
excellent Würfel has also given me a letter to
Klengel,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> in Dresden.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>I must now conclude, as it is quite time to go to
Hankaʼs. I shall introduce myself as godson of
Count Skarbek, and I hope that no further recommendation
will be necessary.</p>

<p class="right">
Your FREDERIC.
</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Dresden, August 26th, 1829.</i>
</p>

<p>I am merry and well. When I was in Vienna, a
week ago, I did not dream I should be in Dresden
to-day. Our stay at Prague was very short, but not
without profit. Herr Hanka was very pleased to
receive news from Skarbek. Like all visitors to the
Prague Museum who have received any special attention
from Herr Hanka, we had to write our names in
a book kept for the purpose; we found among others
the names of Brodzinski, Mocawski,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> &amp;c. Each of
us wrote whatever occurred to him in poetry or
prose. What could I, a musician, write that would
be worth reading? The thought happily struck
Maciejowski to write four strophes for a Mazurka,
and I set them to music; so I think we have both
immortalized ourselves in the most characteristic
manner.</p>

<p>Hanka was delighted with this idea, for the
Mazourka contained a reference to him and to his
efforts for the elevation of the Slavs. He has given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
me several views of Prague for Skarbek. I cannot
possibly tell you by letter all that Herr Hanka
showed us. I must describe, verbally, the lovely
views, the majestic cathedral, with the figure of
St. John, in silver, the beautiful chapel of St.
Wenceslaus, inlaid with amethysts and other precious
stones, and many other things.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">MEETING WITH KLENGEL.</span>I am indebted to Blahetkaʼs and Würfelʼs letters
for the friendly reception which I had from Pixis.
He gave up his lessons, kept me at his house, and
asked me about all sorts of things. I noticed
Klengelʼs visiting card on his table, and asked if
it belonged to a relative of the famous Klengel, of
Dresden. “Klengel himself is here,” replied Pixis;
“he called while I was out.”</p>

<p>I was delighted at the prospect of becoming acquainted
with this artist, to whom I had letters
from Würfel. I spoke to Pixis about it, and he
invited me to come in the afternoon, if I wished to
meet Klengel, as he was expected then. We met by
accident on the steps of Pixisʼs house, and effected
our first acquaintance there. I listened to his fugues
for more than two hours; I did not play, as I was
not asked. Klengelʼs playing pleased me, but, to
speak candidly, I had expected something still
better. (I pray you not to mention this to anyone.)
He gave me an introductory letter with the following
address: “Al ornatissimo Signore Cavaliere Morlacchi,
primo Maestro della Capella Reale;” in which
he begs this gentleman to make me acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>with the whole musical world of Dresden, and
in particular to present me to Fräulein Pechwell.
This lady is a pupil of Klengelʼs and, in his opinion,
the first pianist in Dresden. He was extremely
affable towards me. Before his departure—he is
going to Vienna and Italy—I spent a couple of
hours with him, and our conversation never flagged.
This has been a very agreeable acquaintanceship,
and I value it more highly than Czernyʼs; but not a
word of this either, my dear ones.</p>

<p>The three delightful days in Prague were over
before we were aware.</p>

<p>I am, as you know, very absent-minded, and on
the day we left rushed suddenly into a strange
room without knowing. “Good morning,” said a
cheerful voice. “I beg your pardon, I mistook the
number,” I answered, and ran away as fast
as possible. We left Prague at noon in a private
carriage, and arrived at Teplitz towards evening.
The next day I found in the list at the Baths
Ludwig Lempickiʼs name; I immediately went to
call on him. He was very glad to see me, and
told me there were several Poles here; among
others he mentioned old Pruszack, Joseph Köhler,
and Kretkowski, from Kamiona. Lempicki told
me that they generally all dined together in the
“German hall,” but that to-day he was invited to
Prince Claryʼs Castle. This Prince belongs to one
of the most distinguished of the Austrian princely
families. He is very wealthy, and owns the town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of Teplitz. Princess Clary, née Countess Chotek<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
is sister of the present Oberstburggraf of Bohemia.
Lempicki said he was quite at home in Prince
Claryʼs house, and would introduce me there in
the evening when the Princess always gave receptions;
he would mention my name to them at
dinner. Having no engagement for the evening,
I accepted the proposal with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">VISIT TO PRINCE CLARY.</span>
We have seen all that is worth seeing here, and
have also been to Dux, the residence of the Count
Waldsteins. We were shown the halberd with
which Albrecht Waldstein (or Wallenstein) was
stabbed, a piece of his scull, and other relics.
In the evening, instead of going to the theatre,
I dressed and went with Lempicki to the Castle.
I put on my white gloves which had already done
duty at the Vienna concert. The company was
not numerous, but very select: an Austrian prince;
an Austrian general, whose name I forget; an
English naval captain; two or three elegant dandies
(Austrian princes or counts, I believe); and the
Saxon General von Leiser, who bore the uncommon
decoration of a scar on his face.</p>

<p>I talked most to Prince Clary. After tea Countess
Chotek, mother of the Princess, asked me to play.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>The instrument was a good one, by Graff. I took
my seat at the piano, and asked the company to
give me a theme for improvisation. The ladies, who
had established themselves at a table, immediately
whispered to each other “un thème, un thème.”
Three pretty young princesses, after some consultation,
referred to a Herr Fritsche,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> tutor to Prince
Claryʼs only son, and he suggested the chief theme
in Rossiniʼs “Moses,” which was unanimously
approved of. I improvised, I suppose with some
success, for General von Leiser had a long talk
with me afterwards. When he heard I was going
to Dresden, he at once wrote the following to Baron
von Friesen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Monsieur Frédéric Chopin est recommandé de la part
du General Leiser à Monsieur le Baron de Friesen, Maître
de Cérémonie de S. M. le roi de Saxe, pour lui être utile
pendant son séjour à Dresde, et de lui procurer la connaissance
de plusieurs des premiers artistes.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Below was written in German: “Herr Chopin is
one of the best pianists I have heard.” I copied
this literally for you, my dearests, from the generalʼs
pencil letter.</p>

<p>I had to play four times. The Prince and
Princess asked me to prolong my stay at Teplitz,
and dine with them the next day. Lempicki offered
to accompany me to Warsaw, if I remained a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
day or two here, but I could not hear of being
separated from my companions, so, with many
thanks, I declined both proposals.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ARRIVAL IN DRESDEN.</span>
We left yesterday morning, at 5 oʼclock, in a
carriage, for which we paid two Thalers, and arrived
at Dresden at four in the afternoon, when we met
Lewinski and Lebecki. Everything has happened
very fortunately for me throughout the journey.
The first part of “Faust” is to be given to-day, and
Klengel tells me that the Italian opera will be on
Saturday.</p>

<p>This letter was begun last night. Now I must
dress for calling on Baron von Friesen and Morlacchi,
so have no time to spare. We intend leaving in
a week, but, weather permitting, not without seeing
the Saxon Switzerland. We hope to spend a few
days in Breslau, and go direct home from there.
I am longing so much to see you again, my dear
parents, that I do not at all care to go to Wiesiolowskiʼs
first. Oh, how many stories and adventures
I shall have to relate, and each more interesting
than the last.</p>

<p>P.S.—Baron von Friesen, maître dé cérémonie,
received me very kindly. He asked me where I was
staying, and regretted that the Chamberlain, who
was also director of the royal band, was not at
Dresden just now, but he would find out who was
his deputy, and do all he could to show me
something worth seeing during my short sojourn.
Whereupon many bows and stammered thanks on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>my part. My next letter, from Breslau, will tell you
the rest.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> I have seen the world-renowned gallery,
the fruit show, the gardens, have paid some visits,
and am now going to the theatre. Enough, I hope,
for one day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Postscript.</span>—It is night. Just returned
from the theatre, where I saw “Faust.”<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> The rush
was so great that we had to be in the <i>queue</i>, outside
the office, before five oʼclock, to get a ticket at all.
The performance began at six, and lasted till
eleven oʼclock. Devrient,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> whom I saw in Berlin,
acted <i>Faust</i>. A fearful but magnificent conception.
Portions of Spohrʼs Opera, “Faust,” were performed
as Entrʼactes. Goetheʼs eightieth birthday was
celebrated to-day. Now I am off to bed, I expect
Morlacchi early to-morrow, and shall go with him
to Fräulein Pechwellʼs, that is, he will come
with me.</p>

<p class="right padr5">Good night,</p>

</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="36" height="60" alt="T" /></span>HE innocent youthful gaiety which accompanied
Chopin on his journey was his faithful companion
for some time to come. The brilliant success
of his two performances in Vienna assured him that
he really had talent, and that his parents had not
done wrong in allowing him to dedicate himself
wholly to art.</p>

<p>He returned from his second journey with wider
views and riper judgment. He left off drawing
caricatures, with which, in boyish mischief, he had
often amused himself in Berlin. He felt, with
intense delight, that the wings of his genius were
bearing him higher than they did a year ago. With
his inborn modesty he was surprised that great
musicians should marvel at his playing; he had,
indeed, already the courage to defend his opinions
when they differed from those of other musicians;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
but he always spoke with a certain reserve and
courtesy, which prevented him from giving offence,
nor did he forget to pay the respect which the young
man owes to the elder. “That Vienna would lose
much if he went away without letting people hear
him,” was incomprehensible to the modest youth not
yet fully conscious of his talents.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Chopin that he always
began his letters in a clear elegant hand; but, as
if overpowered by the rush of thought and feeling,
the writing, as he proceeded, grew larger and more
hurried. His Polish letters are pithy and natural,
and often contain surprisingly original thoughts.
A great deal cannot be transcribed into German,
although this language bears the palm for the best
translations.</p>

<p>Fredericʼs humorous nature was often displayed in
the address of a letter. For example, he sent one to
his father directed “To the Right Hon. N. Chopin,
Professor in Warsaw, and to the dear parents of the
son who is in Dresden.” He would often call his
sisters “my children” (mojo dzieci), out of tenderness,
and add some playful affectionate expressions.
He never forgot to send remembrances to his
much-honoured teachers, Zwyny and Elsner, nor to
gladden his fellow collegians and intimate friends
by kind words as reminders of himself.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS HEALTH.</span>
It has become the custom with most of the
writers on Chopin to dilate on his weak and exhausted
health. The grossest exaggerations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
been current on this point, and, as is nearly always
the case, more credence has been given to the
exaggerations than to the truth. Goethe says truly,
“People believe the truth so little because it is so
simple.”</p>

<p>It has been said of Chopin that he suffered from
his earliest years from an incurable malady which
might have caused death at any moment. This
may have been the reason why Liszt describes him
as very sickly when only a youth of fifteen or
sixteen; among other things about him he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“* * * * Chopin was more like one of those
ideal creations with which the poetry of the middle ages
adorned the Christian temples: a beautiful angel, with
a form pure and slight as a young god of Olympus, with
a face like that of a majestic woman filled with a divine
sorrow, and, as the crown of all, an expression at the
same time tender and severe, chaste and impassioned.</p>

<p>“He daily accustomed himself to think that the hour
of his death was near, and, under the influence of this
feeling, he accepted the careful attentions of a friend,
from whom he concealed how short a time, he believed,
remained for him on earth. He possessed great physical
courage, and, if he did not accept with the heroic carelessness
of youth the idea of his approaching end, he at
least cherished the expectation of it with a kind of bitter
pleasure.”</p></blockquote>

<p>These remarks are not applicable to that period
of Chopinʼs life, for they are not in accordance with
the facts. Chopin neither looked like “a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
angel,” “a majestic woman filled with a divine
sorrow,” nor “a young god from Olympus;” just as
little did he imagine daily “that the hour of his
death was near.” On the contrary, his cheerful
letters, pervaded with the joy of youth, showed that
Frederic had as good health as any other young
man of his age. When travelling he saw all that
was worth seeing, gave two concerts within a week,
paid several visits, was present at long performances
at the theatre, and wrote a great many letters
besides. Undeniably, Chopin had a delicate constitution,
but he was healthy, and strong enough to
bear the fatigue of travelling in a diligence.</p>

<p>It was not until ten years later that he was
threatened with the illness brought on by the excitement
of Paris life. And if Frederic had been
sickly, would his parents have permitted their only,
tenderly loved son to travel abroad? Would they
have consented to an absence of two years—which
followed the earlier journeys—if the young artist
had been troubled with a dangerous malady? Only
in the last years of his life his physical strength was
often greatly exhausted, in consequence of the rapid
strides of the disease which caused his early death.</p>

<p>Chopinʼs playmate and schoolfellow, Wilhelm von
Kolberg, who is still living in Warsaw, affirms that
till manhood, Chopin was only ill once, and then
from a cold. It is true that after the manner of
loving womanly hearts, mother and sisters very
much petted their dear Frederic. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
lack of exhortations to “wrap up carefully in cold
damp weather;” he laughed good-humouredly at the
instructions, but followed them like an obedient son.</p>

<p>There were moments when, buried in thought,
Frederic paid little heed to the outer world, and
avoided even his best friends. These were times of
communion with his muse, and he would suffer the
intervention of no third person.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS DISPOSITION.</span>
In a general way he was fond of pleasure, and
delighted to share it with his parents, family and
friends. He never marred anyoneʼs enjoyment. If
he were among company who wished to dance, he
would sit down to the piano without being pressed
and play the most charming Mazurkas and other
dances. If a bad player were at the piano, he would
politely and pleasantly put himself in his place. In
after years also, when he lived in Paris and had
acquired a European reputation, he was always
willing, in the kindest manner, to delight a Polish
family with some national dances. As a player he
was as indefatigable as the dancers, who in their
enthusiasm often did not know how to stop.</p>

<p>Like all intelligent young men, Frederic returned
from his travels with a wider knowledge of human
nature. He perceived that the artists, whose acquaintance
he had lately made, were not all so
amiable and free from envy as he had imagined; he,
therefore, clung the closer to the more noble-minded
among his compeers, for whom he retained through
life a friendly recollection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, he did not fail to meet with bitter
disappointments in later years.</p>

<p>The artists in Vienna looked upon Chopin as a
young man with a thorough and most refined
musical education, who was not puffed up with
vanity, and had no thought of settling in the
Imperial city. They were, therefore, favourably
disposed towards him, and willingly lent their
assistance.</p>

<p>Like every true artist and poet, Chopin was
tormented with doubts as to the extent and range
of his genius. Some, indeed, who heard him at
the concerts which he gave in Vienna, said that
his playing was not powerful enough; but with
regard to his compositions there was but one
opinion. Real connoisseurs of pianoforte playing,
truly musical souls, knew how to value the smoothness,
certainty, and elegance of his style. The
wonderful penetrating and melancholy expression
peculiar to Chopinʼs playing, found a response in
all poetical minds. He was pre-eminently the
pianist for poets, and could not be exalted too
highly above the mass, who only desire technical
skill and noise; the musicians were especially
interested by the character and originality of his
compositions. To complete the story of his Vienna
experiences, I give two letters to his most intimate
friend Woyciechowski.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">HIS GREAT JOURNEY.</span><br /><br /></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, September 12th, 1829.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Titus</span>,
</p>

<p>You would not have heard from me, if I had not
met Vicentius Skarbek, and thereby been reminded
that you would be in Warsaw by the end of this
month. I hoped that I should have been able to
tell you personally of my <span class="smcap">GREAT JOURNEY</span>, for truly
and sincerely I should only be too glad to have a
chat with you. But as this is unfortunately impossible,
let me tell you, dear, that I have been to
Cracow, Vienna, Prague, Dresden and Breslau.</p>

<p>We passed the first week at Cracow in taking
walks, and visiting the neighbourhood. Ojcow is
very beautiful; but I shall not say anything, for
although you were not there, you know all about
it from Tanskaʼs accurate descriptions. I had good
company on my way to Vienna; if Cracow made so
many demands upon me that I could not find a
few moments to think of you and my family, Vienna
so utterly stupefied and infatuated me, that, although
a fortnight passed without my receiving a letter from
home, I felt no longing for my friends. Just imagine
my playing twice in the Royal and Imperial Theatre
in so short a time. This is how it came about: my
publisher Haslinger represented to me that it would
be of advantage to my compositions if I were to
appear in Vienna; that my name was as yet unknown,
and my music difficult both to play and
understand.</p>

<p>I did not yet think of it seriously, and replied:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>“That I had not played a note for a fortnight,
and so was not prepared to present myself before
a select and critical public.” In the meantime
Count Gallenberg, who writes pretty ballets, and is
manager of the Vienna theatre, came in. Haslinger
introduced me to him as a coward, afraid of appearing
in public. The Count very obligingly placed the
theatre at my disposal, but I was shrewd enough to
decline, with thanks. The next day Würfel came
in, and urged me not to bring disgrace on my
parents, Elsner, and myself by neglecting the opportunity
of performing in Vienna.</p>

<p>As soon as I had yielded to all this pressure,
Würfel at once undertook the necessary preparations.
The next morning bills announced my
concert. It was impossible, therefore, to retreat,
although I did not know how or what I should play.
Three manufacturers proposed to send me pianos,
but, owing to the narrow limits of my lodgings, I
was obliged to refuse their offers. What would
have been the use either of my practising a great
deal two days before the concert?</p>

<p>In one day I made the acquaintance of all the
great artists in Vienna, among them Mayseder,
Gyrowetz, Lachner, Kreutzer, Schuppanzigh, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DÉBUT IN VIENNA.</span>
The members of the orchestra looked sourly at
me during the rehearsal; they were particularly
vexed at my making my <i>débût</i> with new compositions.
Then I began the Variations dedicated to you, which
were to come after the Rondo Cracovienne. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Variations were a success, but the Rondo, owing to
the way in which it was written, went so badly that
we were obliged to commence from the beginning
twice. I ought to have put the pauses below instead
of above. Enough; the gentlemen made such wry
faces that I felt very much inclined to announce
myself ill in the evening.</p>

<p>Demmar, the manager, noticed the ill-temper of
the orchestra, who do not like Würfel. The latter
wished to conduct himself, but the orchestra declined
(I donʼt know why) to play under his lead. Herr
Demmar advised me to improvise, at which proposal
the orchestra stared. I was so much irritated by
what had happened that I consented in despair;
and who knows whether my miserable mood and
strange humour were not the cause of the great
success I achieved?</p>

<p>The presence of the Viennese public did not excite
me at all, and I sat down, very calmly, to a wonderful
instrument of Graffʼs, the best, perhaps, then in
Vienna. Beside me sat a young man, covered with
rouge, who had turned over for me in the Variations,
and plumed himself on having rendered the same
service to Moscheles, Hummel, and Herz. I played,
as you may imagine, in a desperate mood; the
Variations, nevertheless, made such an effect that I
was encored enthusiastically. Fräulein Veltheim
sang very beautifully. As to my Improvisation I
only know that it was followed by a storm of
applause and many recalls.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Vienna newspapers were lavish in their praise.
By universal desire I played again a week after, congratulating
myself that no one could say now that I
was only able to appear once. I was especially
pleased with the performance of the Rondo, because
Gyrowetz, Lachner, and other masters, and even the
orchestra were so delighted—forgive me for saying
so—that they recalled me twice. I was obliged to
repeat the Variations (at the special request of the
ladies); Haslinger, too, was so pleased with them
that he is going to bring them out in <i>Odeon</i>; a great
honour for me, is it not?</p>

<p>Lichnowski, one of Beethovenʼs friends, wished to
lend me his piano for the concert (this is, indeed,
something), as it seemed to him that mine was too
weak. But this was on account of my style of playing,
which pleased the ladies so much; especially
Fräulein Blahetka. It might be that she is favourably
disposed towards me (by the way, she is not
yet twenty, a lovely and intelligent girl). At my
departure she honoured me by a composition, with
an inscription in her own handwriting.</p>

<p>The <i>Wiener Zeitung</i> said, in a notice of the second
concert, “This is a young man who knows how to
please by entirely original means. His style differs
totally from that of the ordinary concert giver.” I
hope this is satisfactory, especially as the article
concludes, “Herr Chopin to-day again received the
most unanimous applause.” Pardon me for writing
such an opinion of myself, but I do so because it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
pleases me more than any amount of praise in
the <i>Warsaw Courier</i>.</p>

<p>I became quite intimate with Czerny, and often
played with him on two pianos. He is a good-natured
man, but nothing more. Klengel, whom I
saw at Pixisʼs, in Prague, I like best of all my
artistic acquaintances. He played his fugues to
me (one might call them a continuation of Bachʼs,
there are forty-eight, and as many canons.) What
a contrast to Czerny! Klengel gave me a letter of
introduction to Morlacchi, in Dresden. We visited
the Saxon Switzerland, so rich in natural beauties,
and the magnificent picture gallery; but the Italian
Opera had to be given up before my very eyes. I
was, unfortunately, obliged to leave the day on
which “Crociato in Egitto” was to be performed.
My only consolation was that I had already heard it
in Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">STAY IN DRESDEN.</span>
Frau Pruszak, and her two children, Alexandrine
and Constantin, are in Dresden. I met them the
day I left. What a pleasure! They called out,
“Pan Frycek, Pan Frycek;”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> it was so charming
that I should certainly have stayed but for my
companions. Herr Pruszak I met at Teplitz. Teplitz
is a wonderfully beautiful place. I was only there a
day, but went to a soirée at Prince Claryʼs.</p>

<p>I have been too much absorbed in my writing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>be able to stop. I affectionately embrace you, and
kiss your lips, if you allow me.</p>

<p class="right">Your FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, October 3rd, 1829.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Titus</span>,</p>

<p>You write that you have read something about
my concerts in two newspapers; if they were
Warsaw papers, you could certainly not have been
gratified, for not only is their translation bad, but
they have taken the trouble to distort, to my disparagement,
the comments of the Viennese critics.
The Vienna <i>Sammler</i> and the <i>Zeitschrift für Literatur</i>,
from which Hube brought me the extracts, made the
most flattering criticisms on my playing and compositions
(pardon me for writing this to you), and
called me, in conclusion, “An independent <i>virtuoso</i>,
full of delicacy and the deepest feeling.”<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> If such
extracts had fallen into your hands I should have no
occasion to be ashamed.</p>

<p>You will learn from me bye and bye what I think
of doing this winter. In no case shall I remain in
Warsaw; where fate will lead me I do not yet know.
Prince and Princess Radziwill have, in the most
polite manner, invited me to Berlin, and offered me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
apartments in their palace; but of what use would
this be? I have begun so much work that it would
seem the wisest course for me to remain here. I
have also promised to return to Vienna, and a
Vienna paper openly declared that a sojourn in the
Imperial city would be very advantageous to me, and
have the best influence on my career.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS IDEAL.</span>
You will, perhaps, think so too; but do not
imagine that I am thinking about Fräulein Blahetka,
whom I mentioned in my letter. I have already—to
my misfortune, perhaps—found my ideal, which I
sincerely and loyally worship. Half a year has
passed without exchanging a syllable with her of
whom I dream every night. While thinking of this
lovely being I composed the Adagio in my new
Concerto,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> and early this morning the Waltz, which
I send you. Notice the passage marked +, nobody
knows of it but yourself. How glad I should be if I
could play my newest compositions to you, my dear
friend. In the fifth bar of the Trio, the melody in
the bass must rise to the higher E flat in the violin
cleff, which, however, I need not tell you, for you
will feel it for yourself.</p>

<p>I have no other news to send than that every
Friday there is music at Kesslerʼs. Yesterday they
played, among other things, Spohrʼs Octett, a wonderful
work. I go to Brzezinaʼs<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> every day; he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>nothing new but Pixisʼs Concerto which made no
great impression on me; the Rondo seems the best
part of it. You cannot imagine how dull Warsaw
looks. If it were not for the happiness I find with
my family I could not live here.</p>

<p>Oh, how miserable it is to have no one to share
your sorrows and joys, and, when your heart is
heavy, to have no soul to whom you can pour out
your woes. You know very well what I mean.
How often do I communicate to my piano all that
I would confide to you.</p>

<p>My friend, you must change into a delightful
reality my dream of travelling with you abroad. I
do not know what I should do for joy. But, alas,
our ways lie wide apart.</p>

<p>I hope to go to Italy, from Vienna, for my further
improvement, and next winter I am to meet Hube
in Paris; but everything may be altered, as my kind
father would like me to go to Berlin, for which, to
say the truth, I have no great desire. If, as I trust, I
go to Vienna, I shall, perhaps, choose the way through
Dresden and Prague, to visit Klengel again; also
the famous picture gallery and the Conservatoire.</p>

<p>I must now leave off, or I shall only weary you
with my dry news, and I do not want to do that.
If you would only write me a few lines, it would give
me pleasure for several weeks. Forgive me for
sending you the Waltz, which will make you angry
with me in the end. My intention is to please you.</p>

<p class="right">
Your FREDERIC.
</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>The favourable critiques in the Vienna newspapers
of Chopinʼs playing awakened universal interest in
Warsaw, and caused his father to take counsel with
Elsner and other friends about Fredericʼs further
training. All agreed on sending the young artist
for a longer sojourn abroad. Warsaw offered, indeed,
little artistic stimulus to Chopinʼs extraordinary
abilities; he passed there for a perfect artist. His
compositions, published in Warsaw, are among the
best he ever wrote, and if his creative talent grew
and matured in later years, his early works bear the
true Chopin stamp.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PROPOSED TOUR TO PARIS AND ITALY.</span>
Elsnerʼs advice was that Chopin should go to
Italy first, then to Paris, and so be away two years
in all. From letters to his friend, Titus Woyciechowski,
who now resides at his estate Poturzyn,
in Poland, and who very kindly furnished these
letters, we learn from Frederic himself how he
passed the next few years. It is most fortunate
for us that his most intimate friend has religiously
preserved, as sacred memorials, every line of the
talented artist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, October 20th, 1829.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Titus</span>,</p>

<p>You wonʼt know how to make out why such a
writing mania has suddenly seized me, and how it is
that, in so short a time, I send you a third letter.</p>

<p>I start at seven this evening, <i>per diligence</i>, for
Wiesiowlowskiʼs, in Posen, and so write to you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>beforehand, not knowing how long I shall stay
there, though I have only got a passport for a
month. My idea is to return in about a fortnight.
The object of my journey is to see Prince Radziwill,
who is living at his estate not far from Kalitz. He
wishes me to go to Berlin, and live as a guest in his
house, &amp;c.; but I cannot see that it would be of any
real, that is to say, artistic use. “Mit grossen
Herren ist nicht gut Kirschen essen.”</p>

<p>My good father will not believe that these invitations
are merely <i>des belles paroles</i>.</p>

<p>Forgive me if I repeat myself. I easily forget
what I have written, and often fancy I am giving
you news which is really stale.</p>

<p>Kessler gives a musical soirée every Friday; nearly
all the artists here meet together, and play whatever
is brought forward, <i>prima vista</i>; so, for example,
there were performed, last Friday: Concerto in C
sharp minor, by Ries, with quartet accompaniment;
then Trio in E major, by Hummel; Beethovenʼs
last Trio, which I thought magnificent and impressive;
also a Quartet, by Prince Louis Ferdinand
of Prussia, <i>alias</i> Dussek;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> and singing to conclude
with.</p>

<p>Elsner has praised my Concerto Adagio. He says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
there is something new in it. As for the Rondo I do
not want any opinion on that at present, for I am
not satisfied with it myself. I wonder whether I
shall finish it when I return.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your letter, which
pleased me exceedingly. You have the happy gift
of cheering and delighting one. You cannot imagine
how despondent I was in the morning, and how my
spirits rose when I received your letter. I embrace
you warmly. Many write this at the end of their
letters and scarcely think about it; but you know,
dearest friend, that I do it sincerely, as truly as I
am called “Fritz.” I have composed a Study in my
style; when we meet again I will play it to you.</p>

<p class="right padr3">Your faithful</p>

<p class="right">FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, Sunday, November 14th, 1829.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Titus</span>,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">VISIT TO PRINCE RADZIWILL.</span>
I received your last letter at Radziwillʼs, at
Antonin. I was there a week, and you cannot think
how quickly and pleasantly the time passed. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>travelled back by the last Post, and had great
trouble to get away. As for myself I could
have stayed there till I was driven away, but my
occupations, and, above all, my concerto, which
still impatiently awaits its <i>Finale</i>, forced me to quit
Paradise.</p>

<p>My dear Titus, there were three daughters of Eve
there; the young princesses, extremely amiable,
musical, and kind-hearted; and the Princess, their
mother, who knows quite well that the value of a
man does not depend on his descent, is so lady-like
and amiable towards everyone that it is impossible
not to honour her.</p>

<p>You know what a lover of music the Prince is.
He showed me his “Faust,” and I found much that
is really beautiful in it; some parts, indeed, show
considerable intellectual power. Between ourselves,
I certainly should not have accredited a Stadtholder
with such music. I was struck, among other things,
by the scene where Mephistopheles allures Margaret
to the window, by playing the guitar and singing
outside her house, while a Chorale is heard at the
same time in the neighbouring church. This is sure
to produce a great sensation. I only mention this to
give you an idea of his style. He is also a great
admirer of Gluck. In the drama, he only gives
importance to music in so far as it depicts the
situation or the feelings, therefore the Overture has
no conclusion, but leads directly to the introduction.
The orchestra is always invisible, placed behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
stage,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> so as not to distract the attention by such
externals as the conducting, the movements of the
musicians, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">TEACHING A PRINCESS.</span>
I wrote an “Alla Polacca,” with ʼcello accompaniment
during my visit to Prince Radziwill. It is
nothing more than a brilliant drawing-room piece—suitable
for the ladies. I should like Princess Wanda
to practice it. I am supposed to have given her
lessons. She is a beautiful girl of seventeen, and it
was charming to direct her delicate fingers. But,
joking apart, she has real musical feeling, and does
not need to be told when to play <i>crescendo</i>, <i>piano</i>, or
<i>pianissimo</i>. Princess Elise was so much interested
in my Polonaise (F minor) that I could not refuse to
send for it. Please let me have it by return of post.
I did not wish to be thought impolite, but I should
not like to write it out of my head again, my dearest,
for I should, perhaps, make it very different from
the original. You can picture to yourself the
character of the Princess from her having me play
the Polonaise to her every day. The Trio in A flat
major always pleases her particularly.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> She wishes
me much to go to Berlin in May, so nothing stands
in the way of my going to Vienna in the Winter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>It does not seem likely that I shall get off before
December. Papaʼs birthday is on the sixth, which
I shall, in any case, keep with him. I do not think
of starting till the middle of December. I hope also
to see you again.</p>

<p>You would not believe what a blank I feel in
Warsaw just now. I have no one to whom I can
speak a couple of really confidential words. You
want one of my portraits. I certainly would have
sent it you if I could have stolen one from Princess
Elise, who has two in her album, which, I am
assured are very faithful likenesses; but you, my
dearest, need no picture of me. Believe me, I am
always with you and will never forget you to the
end of my life.</p>

<p>I remind you once more of the Polonaise; please
send it by return. I have written some studies; I
should play them well in your presence. Last Saturday,
Kessler played Hummelʼs E major Concerto, at
the Ressource. Next Saturday, perhaps, I shall
play; I shall choose the Variations dedicated to
you.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, March 27th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I never missed you so much as now. I have no
one to whom I can pour out my heart. A single
look from you, after the concert, would be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
to me than the praise of all the critics here.
Immediately on the receipt of your letter, I wanted
to describe my first concert to you; but I was so
distracted and busy with preparations for the
second, which took place on Monday, that I was
not capable of collecting my thoughts. I am not,
indeed, in a much better mood to-day, but I cannot
delay the sending of this letter any longer, for the
post goes, and who knows when my mind will be
at rest again?</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE FIRST CONCERT IN VIENNA.</span>
The first concert, for which three days before
there was neither box nor stall to be had, did not,
on the whole, make the impression I had expected.
The first Allegro of the F. minor concerto (not
intelligible to everyone) was indeed rewarded with
a bravo, but this was, I think, because the public
wished to show that it knew how to understand
and appreciate earnest music. In every country
there are plenty of people who readily assume the
airs of connoisseurs. The Adagio and Rondo made
a great effect and were followed by the heartiest
applause and shouts of bravo. But the Potpurri
on Polish songs<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> completely missed its mark.
They applauded indeed, but, evidently, only to show
the player they were not wearied with him.</p>

<p>Kurpinski<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> thought he discovered fresh beauties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>in my concerto that evening. Ernemann was
entirely satisfied. Elsner regretted that my piano
was not stronger, the bass being, as he thought,
not heard clearly enough.</p>

<p>Those sitting in the gallery or standing in the
orchestra appear to have been most satisfied; there
were complaints in the pit of the playing being
too soft. I should very much like to know the
gossip about me at “Kopciuszek.”<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> In consequence
of the remarks in the pit, Mochnacki,
after highly praising me—especially for the Adagio
in the <i>Polish Courier</i>—advised me, for the future,
to use more power and energy. I knew quite well
where this power lay, so at the second concert I
did not play on my own but on a Vienna instrument.
This time the audience, again very large, were
perfectly content. The applause knew no bounds,
and I was assured that every note rang out like a
bell, and that I played much more finely than
before. When I appeared, in reply to a recall, they
called out “give another concert.” The Cracovienne
produced a tremendous sensation; there were four
rounds of applause. Kurpinski regretted that I had
not played the Polish Fantasia on the Vienna piano,
a remark which Grzymala repeated the other day in
the <i>Polish Courier</i>. Elsner says I could not be
properly judged of until after the second concert.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
I confess, candidly, that I would rather have played
on my own instrument. The Vienna piano was
generally regarded as more appropriate to the size of
the building.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PROGRAMME OF THE FIRST CONCERT.</span>
You know what the programme of the first
concert was.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> The second began with a Symphony
by Nowakowski<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> (par complaisance) followed by a
repetition of the first Allegro of my Concerto. Then
the Theatre Concert-master, Bulawski, played an Air
Varié, by Beriöt, and I, my Allegro and Rondo again.
The second part commenced with the Rondo Cracovienne.
Meier sang an air from Solivaʼs opera,
“Helene and Malvina,” and, in conclusion, I improvised
on the Volkslied “W—miescie dziwne
obyczaje,” (there are strange customs in the town)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>which very much pleased the people in the first
rows. To be candid I must say that I did not
improvise as I had intended, but, perhaps, that
would not have been so well suited to the audience.
I wonder that the Adagio pleased so generally; from
all I hear, it is with reference to this that the most
flattering observations have been made. You must
have read the newspapers, and you will see that the
public were very pleased with me.</p>

<p>A poem, addressed to me, and a large bouquet
were sent to my house. Mazurkas and Waltzes
are being arranged on the principal themes from
my Concerto. Brzezina asked for my likeness, but
I declined giving it. This would be too much all at
once, besides I do not like the prospect of butter
being wrapped up in the paper on which I am
pourtrayed, as was the case with Lelewelʼs portrait.</p>

<p>Wishes are expressed on all sides that I should
give a third concert, but I have no desire to do so.
You would not believe the excitement one has to go
through for some days before the performance. I
hope to finish the first Allegro of the second Concerto
before the vacation, so I shall wait, at any rate, till
after Easter, although I am convinced that I should
have a larger audience than ever this time; for the
“haute volée” have hardly heard me at all yet. At
the last concert a stentorian voice called out from
the pit, “Play at the Town Hall,” but I doubt
whether I shall follow this advice; if I play again,
it will be in the theatre. It is not a question of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">PROCEEDS OF THE CONCERTS.</span>
receipts with me, for the Theatre did not bring me
in much. (The cashier, to whom everything was
left, did as he liked.) From both concerts, after all
expenses had been deducted, I did not receive quite
5,000 gulden,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> although Dmuszewski, editor of the
<i>Warsaw Courier</i>, stated that no concert had been so
crowded as mine. Besides, the Town Hall, where
the anxieties and arrangements would be many,
would not please everyone. Dobrzynski<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> is vexed
with me for not performing his symphony. Frau
W. took it amiss that I did not reserve a box for
her, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>I close this letter unwillingly, because I feel as if
I had not told you anything interesting yet. I have
reserved all for the desert which is nothing more
than a warm embrace.</p>

<p class="right">Your FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, May 15th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>You will certainly have wondered that Fritz did
not answer your letter by return of post; but as I
could not immediately give the information you asked
for I delayed writing till to-day.</p>

<p>Now listen, my dearest, Henrietta Sonntag is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>coming to Warsaw in June, or, perhaps, at the
end of May. I am sure you will not neglect the
opportunity of hearing her. Oh, how thankful I
am for it. She must be in Danzig now, and from
there she comes to us. We have several concerts in
prospect. Little Worlitzer, pianist to the King of
Prussia, has already been here a fortnight. He
plays very finely, and being of Jewish descent, has
many natural gifts. He has been with me; he is
just sixteen; some of the things he played at our
house went famously. His best performance is
Moschelesʼs Variations on the Alexander March. He
really plays those excellently. You would like his
style and manner of playing, although—this to you
only—he still lacks much to deserve his title of
Chamber <i>Virtuoso</i>. There is also a French pianist
here, Monsieur Standt. He intended giving a
concert, but seems lately to have relinquished the
idea.</p>

<p>It is an agreeable piece of musical news that Herr
Blahetka, father of the <i>pianiste</i> in Vienna, will, if
I advise him, come here, when the Diet meets, and
give some concerts. But my position is a difficult
one; the man wants to make money, and if it
happens that his hopes are not fulfilled, he will be
angry with me. I answered immediately that I had
often been asked whether he would not come, and
that many musicians and lovers of music would be
glad to hear his daughter; but I did not conceal
from him that Sonntag would be here, that Lipinski
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
was coming, that we have only one theatre, and that
the expenses of a concert amount to at least 100
thalers. He cannot say now that I did not properly
inform him of the state of things. It is very possible
that he will come. I should be very glad, and would
do all in my power to get a full house for his
daughter. I would willingly also play with her on
two pianos; for you would not believe how kindly
her father interested himself for me in Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE NEW CONCERTO.</span>
I do not know yet when I shall commence my
journey. I shall probably be here during the hot
months. The Italian Opera does not begin in
Vienna till September, so I have no occasion to
hurry. The Rondo for the new Concerto is not ready
yet. I have not been in the right mood to finish
it. When the Allegro and Adagio are quite done
with, I shall not be in any anxiety about the <i>Finale</i>.</p>

<p>The Adagio in E major is conceived in a romantic,
quiet, half melancholy spirit. It is to give the
impression of the eye resting on some much loved
landscape which awakens pleasant recollections,
such as a lovely spring moon-light night. I have
written for the violins to accompany <i>con sordini</i>.
Will that have a good effect? Time will show.</p>

<p>Write and tell me when you are coming back to
Warsaw, for it would be worse than it was the first
time if I had to give my concert without you. You
do not know how I love you. Oh, if I could only
prove it! What would I not give to be able to
embrace you heartily once again.</p>

<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, August 21st, 1830.</i></p>

<p>This is my second letter to you. You will scarcely
think it possible, but so it is.</p>

<p>I wrote to you directly after my prosperous return
to Warsaw, but as my parents stopped at Count
Skarbekʼs, at Zelazowa Wola, I, of course stopped
too, and in the hurry forgot to post my letter. But
there is nothing bad in the world that has not some
good in it.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shall not weary you so much with this
as with the last letter, when I had the image of
your quiet country life, which I had just quitted,
constantly before my eyes. I may say, truly, that I
recall it with delight; I always feel a certain longing
after your beautiful country seat. I do not forget
the weeping willow, that Arbaleta! Oh, with what
pleasure do I remember it! You have teased me
enough about it to punish me for all my sins. Let
me tell you what I have done since you left, and
what is settled about my departure.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CONSTANTIA GLADKOWSKA.</span>
I was especially interested with Paërʼs opera,
“Agnese,” because Fräulein Gladkowska made her
<i>débût</i> in it. She looks better on the stage than in a
drawing-room. Her first-rate tragic acting leaves
nothing to be desired, and her vocalization, even to
the high F sharp or G, is excellent. Her <i>nuances</i> are
wonderful, and if her voice was rather tremulous
at first, through nervousness, she sang afterwards
with certainty and smoothness. The opera was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
curtailed which, perhaps, did not make it seem so
tedious to me. The harp romance which Fräulein
Gladkowska sang in the second act was very fine.
I was quite enraptured. She was recalled at the
conclusion of the opera, and greeted with unbounded
ovations.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>In a weekʼs time Fräulein Watkow<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> is to play the
<i>rôle</i> of Fiorilla, in the opera of “Il Turco in Italia,”
which will be sure to please the public better. A
great many people blame the opera of “Agnese,”
without knowing why.</p>

<p>I do not contend that Soliva<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> might have chosen
something better for Gladkowska; “Vestalin”
would, perhaps, have been more suitable, but
“Agnese” is beautiful also; the music has many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>good points, which the young <i>debutante</i> brought out
capitally.</p>

<p>And now what am I to do?</p>

<p>I start next month, but I must first try my
Concerto, for the Rondo is ready now.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, August 31st, 1830.</i></p>

<p>It was high time for your letter to arrive, for as
soon as I received it, I lost my catarrh. Would
that my letters might be endowed with the same
miraculous power.</p>

<p>I still stay here, and nothing, indeed, attracts me
abroad. But I am certain to go next month, in
obedience to my calling, and my reason, which must
be weak, if it were not strong enough to conquer all
other inclinations.</p>

<p>This week I must try the whole of the E minor
Concerto, with quartet accompaniment, to give me
confidence, as Elsner says the first orchestral trial
will not go well. Last Saturday, I tried the Trio,
and, perhaps, because I had not heard it for so long,
was satisfied with myself. “Happy man,” you will
say, wonʼt you? It then struck me that it would be
better to use the Viola instead of the Violin, as the
first string predominates in the Violin, and in my
Trio is hardly used at all. The viola would, I think,
accord better with the ʼcello. The Trio will then be
ready to print. So much about myself. Now something
as to the other musicians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FRÄULEIN WOTKOW.</span>
Last Saturday, Soliva brought forward his second
pupil, Fräulein Wotkow, who delighted the whole
house with her natural grace and good acting, also
with her beautiful eyes and pearly teeth. She was
more charming on the stage than any of our actresses.
I scarcely recognized her voice at first, she was so
agitated. But she acted so excellently, no one would
have supposed her to be a <i>debutante</i>. Notwithstanding
the encores and the enormous applause she
received, she did not overcome her embarassment till
the second act, when the capabilities of her voice
revealed themselves, though not quite so fully as at
the rehearsal, and at the performance the day before
yesterday.</p>

<p>In vocal ability Fräulein Wotkow is far surpassed
by Fräulein Gladkowska. If I had not myself heard
the former I should not have believed there could be
such a difference between two singers. Ernemann
shares our opinion, that it is not easy to find a singer
equal to Gladkowska, especially in the bell-like
purity of her intonation, and true warmth of feeling,
which are only properly displayed on the stage.
She entrances her hearers. Wotkow made several
slight mistakes, whilst with Gladkowska one did not
hear a single note that was in the least doubtful,
although she has only performed twice in “Agnese.”</p>

<p>When I saw the two vocalists the day before
yesterday and presented your compliments to them,
they were evidently gratified and commissioned me
to thank you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>Wotkowʼs reception was warmer than Gladkowskaʼs,
which Soliva did not seem to like. He said
to me, yesterday, that he did not wish Wotkow
to win more applause than her fellow pupil. I think
a considerable share of the approbation is to be
ascribed to the character which pleases the public
better (captivated also by the young girlʼs beauty)
than the tragic misery of the unhappy daughter in
Paerʼs opera. Gladkowska is to appear shortly in
the “Diebischen Elster,” but this “shortly” will
last till I am over the mountains. Perhaps you will
then be in Warsaw, and will give me your opinion of
the performance. Her third <i>rôle</i> is to be “Vestalin.”</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, October 5th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I was longing very much for your letter, which
has somewhat soothed me. You cannot conceive
how impatient and wearied (a feeling I cannot
struggle against) I am of everything here. After
the orchestral trial of my second Concerto, it was
decided that I should appear with it at the
Theatre on Monday, 11th instant. Although this
does not quite suit me, I am curious to know
what effect the composition will have on the
public. I hope the Rondo will produce a good
impression generally. Soliva said, “il vous fait
beaucoup dʼhonneur;” Kurpinski thought it contained
originality, and Elsner an especially piquant
rhythm. To arrange a good concert, in the true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
sense of the word, and to avoid the unfortunate
clarionet and flageolet solos, Mdlles. Gladkowska and
Wotkow will give some solo numbers. As to overtures
I will not have the one either to “Leszek,” or
to “Lodoiska,” but that to “William Tell.”</p>

<p>You would hardly imagine the difficulty I had to
obtain permission for the ladies to sing. The Italian
granted it readily, but I had to go to a higher
authority still: to the Minister Mostowski, who
finally agreed, for it makes no difference to him. I
do not know yet what they will sing, but Soliva tells
me that a chorus will be necessary for one of the
arias.</p>

<p>I am certain not to be in Warsaw a week after the
concert. My trunk is bought, the outfit ready, the
score corrected, the pocket handkerchiefs hemmed,
the new stockings and the new coat tried on, &amp;c.
Only the leave-taking remains, and that is the
hardest of all.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, October 12th, 1830.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dearest,</span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE CONCERT “A PERFECT SUCCESS.”</span>
The concert, yesterday, was a perfect success;
I hasten to inform you of it. I was not in the least
anxious, and played as if I had been at home. The
hall was crammed. Görnerʼs symphony opened the
ball; then I played the first Allegro from the E
minor Concerto; the notes seemed to roll along of
themselves on the Streicher piano. A roar of applause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>followed. Soliva was very satisfied; he conducted
his Aria, with chorus, which was very well sung by
Fräulein Wotkow. She looked like a fairy in her
light blue dress. After this Aria came my Adagio
and Rondo, and then the usual interval. Connoisseurs
and lovers of music came on to the stage
and complimented me on my playing, in the most
flattering manner.</p>

<p>The second part began with the <i>Tell</i> Overture.
Soliva conducted capitally, and the impression it
produced was deep and abiding. The Italian was
really so good to me that I owe him my everlasting
gratitude. He afterwards conducted the Cavatina
from “La Donna del Lago,” which Fräulein Gladkowska
sung. She wore a white dress, had roses in
her hair, and looked charmingly beautiful. She has
never sung as she did last evening, except in the air
in “Agnese.” “O, quanto lagrime per te versai,”
and the “tutto detesto” were heard splendidly, even
to the low B. Zielinski declared that this B alone
was worth a thousand ducats.</p>

<p>When I had led the ladies from the stage I played
my Fantasia on National Airs. This time I understood
myself, the orchestra understood me, and the
public understood us both. The Mazovian air, at
the end, made a great sensation. I was so rapturously
applauded that I had to appear four times to
bow my thanks. And, be assured, I did it quite
gracefully, for Brandt had fully instructed me. If
Soliva had not taken my score home and corrected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
it, and, as conductor, restrained me when I wanted
to run away, I do not know what would have
happened. He kept us all so splendidly in check
that I never played so comfortably with an orchestra
before. The Streicher piano was very much liked,
but Fräulein Wotkow still more.</p>

<p>I am thinking of nothing but my packing up. On
Saturday or Wednesday I go out into the wide
world.</p>

<p class="right padr2">Ever your truly affectionate</p>
<p class="right">FREDERIC.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>This last concert, therefore, called forth the most
favourable and enthusiastic notices of Chopin. The
Warsaw newspapers were all full of his praises.
They compared him to the chief European <i>virtuosi</i>,
and prophesied the most brilliant future, saying that
some day Poland would be justly proud of the great
pianist and composer, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The sad but very important day in the life of a
young artist, that on which he leaves his fatherʼs
house, drew near. Frederic had to part, for a
lengthened period, from all that was dearest to
him, home, parents, sisters, and also from that lovely
young artiste, the ideal object of his enthusiastic
love. He was to leave her, and, alas! for ever.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPIN LEAVES WARSAW.</span>
On November 2nd, 1830, he said adieu to his
beloved parents, who gave him their blessing, and
embraced his sisters with tearful eyes. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Warsaw he went first to Kalisz, where he expected
to meet his friend, Titus Woyciechowski, to travel
with him to Vienna, through Breslau and Dresden.
A circle of friends, of which the venerable Elsner
was one, accompanied Frederic to Wola (the first
village beyond Warsaw) where the pupils of the
Conservatoire awaited him and sang a cantata, composed
for the occasion by Elsner. At the banquet
given there in his honour, a silver goblet, of artistic
workmanship filled to the brim with his native earth,
was presented to him. The sight of this beautiful
and ingenious gift caused the shining, art-loving eyes
of Frederic to fill with tears of the deepest emotion.</p>

<p>“May you, wherever you go, never forget your
fatherland, or cease to love it with a warm and
faithful heart,” said the friend who presented him
the goblet in the name of them all. “Think of
Poland, think of your friends, who are proud to call
you their countryman, who expect great things from
you, whose wishes and prayers accompany you.”</p>

<p>The young artist once more pressed the hand of
each, and then turned his steps onwards. Before
him lay the wide, checkered, unknown world; but
the consciousness of a true aim and a green blossoming
hope sustained him.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="36" height="60" alt="T" /></span>O the lover and especially to the <i>connoisseur</i> of
music it will be interesting to make a more
thorough examination of Chopinʼs compositions, in
order to appreciate them rightly, and to learn with
what intellectual equipment he set out on his long
years of travel. His first works were written in a
period of apparent quietness and calm. After the
battle of Waterloo, which had happened during the
peaceful labours of the Vienna Congress, the nations
once more breathed freely; the great conqueror
was in captivity, and the political relations of the
European States seemed for the time settled. Peace,
so much desired, had succeeded at length to the
long and sanguinary wars, and brought with it the
hope of quickened life and renewed effort.</p>

<p>Poland, like every other country, grew conscious
of its own powers, its pride revived, and patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
reformers were energetic in diffusing plans for
the amelioration of its internal affairs. By degrees
chaos resolved itself into order, foreign influences were
shaken off, and foreign customs discarded. Despite
the miseries the country had suffered, some enthusiasts
dreamed that the golden age of the Jagellons
was about to return. Men of science were astir in
the field of discovery, and eagerly seeking to throw
fresh light on established truths. For years the
garlands of fame had been won by bold warriors, and
subtle politicians; now, poet, artist, and <i>savant</i> were
to gather <i>their</i> laurels on the peaceful fields of science
and art. A new intellectual life, full of aspiring
fancy and creative impulse, universally prevailed.</p>

<p>At the Vienna Congress the right of being called
a “kingdom” had been granted only to the smaller
portion of Poland. Although exhausted by the
Napoleonic wars, and earnestly engaged in healing
its own wounds, the nation was anxiously desirous
of restoring culture, and encouraging literature and
art. There was a general feeling that on the
establishment of a new social and political order,
literature—as in Germany and other countries—would
find its subjects in the life and manners of
the people. The outbursts of feeling, the power of
conception, and the universal impulse towards expression
would, it was thought, lay the foundations
of a national poetry, the classic forms not being
considered in harmony with the character of the
Polish nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>Following the example of some industrious collectors
of Polish songs and proverbs, a brisk investigation
was instituted into the literary treasures of
other countries. We had at that time but one
representative of the new æsthetical and philosophical
ideas and poetic tendencies—Casimir Brodzinski.
As professor of Polish Literature at the Warsaw
University, and member of the Scientific Society,
he could not directly oppose the fundamental
principles of his colleagues, who belonged to the
classical school; but these circumstances facilitated
rather than retarded the spread of his opinions,
which he propagated by his lectures at the University
and by essays in the journals. These opinions were
based on the principles of Kant and Schiller, on
the historical study of Polish literature, and on the
<span class="sidenote">RISE OF THE ROMANTIC SCHOOL.</span>
poetical theories of the Romantic School. Casimir
Brodzinski gathered around him a band of talented
young men, and a contest began, which daily became
more violent and bitter, between the Classists and
Romanticists. On one side were the advocates of the
old classic principles; on the other youth, with its
ready enthusiasm for everything new, with such men
as Bohdan Zaleski, Sewerin Goszczynski, Anton
Malczewski, Stephan Witwicki, Moritz Goslowski,
and later on Slowacki and Sigismund Krasinski.
Mickiewicz,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> the gifted author of “Grazyna” and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
“Dziady;” and the greatest of Polish poets, supported
by the historians Lelewel and Brodzinski,
placed himself at the head of the Romantic School,
and his genius soon triumphed over its opponents.</p>

<p>At the time when the battle between the champions
of the two schools was raging hottest, Chopin felt
the first stirrings of creative genius. Living in the
midst of a youthful circle, enthusiastic for national
poetry, which it not unjustly regarded as the basis
of all poetry, he made research for national melodies,
and sought by careful artistic treatment to enhance
their value and give them an assured place in
musical literature. In this he succeeded more completely
than any other composer. No one could
reproduce with such beauty and truth the peculiar
melancholy feeling pervading all Sarmatian melodies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">NATIONAL AND SOCIAL INFLUENCES.</span>
The noblest enthusiasm glows in Chopinʼs music:
it may be called the complement, or rather the
illustration of the new national poetry. An eminent
Polish historian says of it: “A peculiar importance
belongs to Chopinʼs music, because in it more than
in any other our nation is represented in the noblest
light, in the possession of an independence, hitherto
unknown. Such music springs from the same
source as our national poetry.”</p>

<p>With respect to Chopin, the same author also
quotes the following passage from Alfred de Mussetʼs
“Confessions dʼun enfant du siecle,” which characterizes,
with such wonderful poetic feeling and
psychological keenness, the prevailing malady of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the age: “When the war was over, the Emperor an
exile, and portraits of Wellington and Blücher, with
the inscription ‘Salvatoribus mundi,’ adorned every
wall, a new generation was beholding, with gloomy
thought, the ruins of the past. In the veins of
these youths flowed the same warm blood which had
flooded the whole world. Everyone raved about the
snows of Moscow, and the sands of Egypt, every
soul was full of dreams, swelling with lofty thoughts
and panting with desires which were impossible, for
wherever men turned their eyes all was emptiness
and desolation. The more mature believed in nothing,
the learned lived in an eternal contradiction, poets
preached despair. An awful hopelessness raged like
a pest in the civilised world.” If, according to
Alfred de Musset, political and literary circumstances
had exercised so baneful an effect on the
younger generation in France, how much more
excuse was there for such a state of things in
Poland, where hope had turned into scepticism,
and melancholy become a chronic evil.</p>

<p>The sensitive and pliant Sarmatian temperament
is as susceptible to hope as to despair, but the
miserable political condition of the country for
generations could not but foster an inclination to
melancholy. The more finely strung natures, who
perhaps, maintain with difficulty the necessary
equilibrium for ordinary affairs, are, of course most
sensitive to such influences. Considering the political
circumstances of Poland, we can only wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
that misery and despair did not lead the nation to
further extremes.</p>

<p>Among those whose productions expressed their
love for their country, and profound sorrow for its
shameful debasement, Chopin, for tenderness and
refinement, stands pre-eminent. His handsome
aristocratic appearance, and that enthusiasm of
nature, which was transfused into his music, distinguished
him above his compeers. The fatal
events which, at the beginning of the decade of 1830,
brought Poland to the verge of ruin, could not but
influence the works of every native artist. Libelt,
one of the chief poets of that time, sung from the
very depth of his soul:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Die traute Heimathe bietet uns kein Gluck,</div>
<div class="line">Erliegt dem Vaterland das Misgeschick.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>How could Chopin sing a cheerful song out of a
merry heart? He would have had to assume a
cheerfulness he could not feel, which to his intensely
natural character would have been extremely difficult.
Like every great man, he was greatest when left to
the inspirations of his genius. The fire and spirit
of youth, indeed, glowed in his soul, and sweet
melodies flowed from his pen, but through his smile
the hot tear always glistened—a tribute to his
country and to his brethren fallen in her defence.</p>

<p>The Rondo, op. 1 (dedicated to Madame Linde)
composed in 1825, and afterwards arranged as a
duet, although artistically written throughout, is
Chopinʼs weakest work. His individuality was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
at that time fully developed, and Hummelʼs influence
was unmistakable. It is no disparagement of his
talents to say this, for every young pianist of that
period made Hummel his model, and, moreover,
every genius, however independent, begins by unconsciously
imitating his favourite composers and
artists. As an instance of this we need only mention
Beethoven.</p>

<p>In the following works, the “Introduction et
Polonaise brillante pour piano et ʼcello” (op. 3),
the Sonata in C minor, (op. 4), dedicated to Elsner,
and the Trio (op. 8), which, although entitled
“Premier Trio,” has had no successor, the leaning
towards Hummel is still evident; the motives are
easily comprehensible, harmonious, clear and simple
in their development, but the Variations on “Don
Juan” already bear the true Chopin stamp.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SCHUMANN ON CHOPIN.</span>
In 1831, just after the appearance of this piece,
R. Schumann wrote a long article in the <i>Allgemeine
Musikalische Zeitung</i>, under the simple heading, “An
opus 2.” We quote a part of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Eusebius had
just stepped softly into the room. You are familiar
with the ironical smile on the pale face by which he
tries to excite attention. I was sitting at the piano
with Florestan, who is, as you are aware, one of
those peculiar musicians who pre-judge everything
new and extraordinary. But to-day a surprise
awaited him. With the words, ‘Hats off, gentlemen,
a genius!’ Eusebius laid before us a piece
of music of which we were not allowed to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
title. I carelessly turned over the leaves. There is
something fascinating in the enjoyment of music
without sound. I think, too, that every composer
has his own manner of writing notes; Beethoven
looks different to Mozart, just as Jean Paulʼs words
do not look like Goetheʼs. But now it seemed to
me as if quite strange eyes, flowersʼ eyes, basilisksʼ
eyes, peacocksʼ eyes were gazing at me. Light
dawned in places; I thought I saw Mozartʼs ‘La ci
darem la manoʼ entwined in a hundred chords.
Leoporello seemed to be looking steadily at me, and
Don Juan glided past in his white mantle. ‘Now
play it,’ said Florestan. Eusebius consented, and
we sat squeezed in a window niche to listen. He
played like one inspired and brought forth an
innumerable host of the most life-like forms; as
if the enthusiasm of the moment had raised his
fingers beyond their usual possibilities. With the
exception, however, of a happy smile, Florestan
only expressed his approbation by saying that
these Variations might have been Beethovenʼs
or Franz Schubertʼs, if these composers had been
pianoforte <i>virtuosi</i>. But when he turned to the
title page and read, ‘<i>La ci darem la mano</i>, varié
pour le pianoforte par Frédéric Chopin, Oeuvre 2,’
we both cried in astonishment, ‘a second work!’
We were dumbfounded, and could only exclaim,
‘Yes, but this is something clever. Chopin—I
never heard the name, who can he be? An unmistakable
genius. In the Variations, in the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>cluding
movement and in the rondo genius shines
in every bar.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>For one of the greatest musicians in Germany to
write thus enthusiastically of an Opus 2, by an
unknown composer, the work must have been
marked by unusual originality, creative power, and
technical perfection. One of the most noteworthy
of the innumerable services rendered by Robert
Schumann is, that in spite of the most adverse
criticism, he first paved the way for Chopinʼs
popularity in Germany, in which endeavour he
was zealously aided by his wife, the world-famed
pianist, Clara Wieck Schumann.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS MAZURKAS.</span>
Among Chopinʼs works, especially distinguished
for newness of form, we place the Mazurkas, op. 6
and 7. This national dance, with its monotonous,
poor, and apparently common-place rhythm, rose
under Chopinʼs magic touch to a poetic dignity, of
which no Polish musician had hitherto dreamed. I
have already mentioned how carefully and perseveringly
Chopin listened to and assimilated the national
songs; he eliminated all vulgarity from the rhythm,
and retained only its characteristic element, while
the melody he idealised and glorified with his
finest poetry. Thus arose that exquisite series of
mazurkas, filled with gladness and melancholy,
smiles and tears. The two works referred to form,
so to speak, the first links in the chain.</p>

<p>In a foreign country, hundreds of miles from his
beloved home, Chopin often felt an indescribable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
yearning for his family and fatherland. At such
times art was his only, and indeed his best solace.
His piano was his confidant, and for hours he would
pour out his feelings in sweet melancholy strains:
the tones-poems thus composed being among the
finest which ever flowed from his pen. This
mazurka form, peculiar to the Poles, seemed to
reveal a particular phase of feeling shared in more or
less by all Chopinʼs contemporaries. The mazurka
is the musical expression of a national yearning,
and is to every Slav singularly full of charm and
sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS AND FIELDʼS NOCTURNES.</span>
The three Nocturnes (op. 9) are true Petrarchian
sonnets, overflowing with grace, fairy-like charm,
and captivating sweetness; they seem like whisperings,
on a still summer night, under the balcony
of the beloved one. Chopin writes: “I have the
<i>cognoscenti</i> and the poetic natures on my side.” But
the reviewers appear to have belonged to neither
category, for the reception they gave to the nocturnes
was to put their heads together and say, “he has
stolen it from Field!” They even went so far as to
assert that Chopin was a pupil<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> of that composer,
who was then living in St. Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<p>There exists, at all times, a species of half-educated,
envious criticism, ever ready to support
mediocre talent, and to stifle the first germs of
genius. Chopin felt its sting. Foremost among
such opponents was Rellstab, of Berlin, who, in
his journal, the <i>Iris</i>, wrote disparagingly of Chopinʼs
talents and compositions. Sikorski, on the other
hand, well-known as one of the best and most conscientious
of Polish critics, says: “On comparing
Fieldʼs nocturnes with those of Chopin, it must be
candidly confessed that the former do not surpass
the latter; although it is not to be denied that in
spite of some striking Chopin traits, opus 9 somewhat
resembles Fieldʼs works in depth of feeling
and particular turns of expression. Their differences
may be thus described: Fieldʼs nocturnes represent
a cheerful, blooming landscape, bathed in sunshine;
while Chopinʼs depict a romantic, mountainous
region, with a dark back-ground, and lowering clouds
flashing forth lightning.”</p>

<p>Worthy of mention among Chopinʼs early works
are the “Variations brillantes” (op. 12), “Grandes
Etudes” (op. 10), and some very interesting pieces
with orchestral accompaniments, written between
1828—30, for example, “Grand Fantaisie sur des
airs polonais” (op. 13), “Cracovienne” (op. 14),
and two Concertos, of which the one in E minor was
composed before his last journey from Warsaw.
The Fantasia and Rondo are almost unknown to
the German public, although distinguished by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
originality never wanting in Chopinʼs works. The
technical difficulties, and the specifically Polish character
of the earlier works have, perhaps, hindered
their popularity. But this is not the case with the
Concertos in E minor (op. 11), and F minor
(op. 21.)<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Chopinʼs spiritual kinsman, Robert
Schumann, valued them very highly, and made
merry over their opponents, whom he jocosely
likened to the French, in the time of Louis Philippe,
refusing to recognize the legitimate Duke of Modena
as King, because he had ascended the throne by a
revolution.</p>

<p>Chopin never imitated other composers; and
never suffered himself to be misled by unjust blame
or vulgar praise. The approval of genuine musicians
gave him pleasure, but we can say of him, as we
cannot of everyone, that he never courted distinctions
or applause. This noble feature of his character
was sometimes inimical to his interests, for the
gentlemen of the press are not best pleased when a
poet and artist pays no homage to their power by
asking for their help and favour.</p>

<p>In 1834, Schumann wrote, in his “Gesammelte
Schriften über Musik und Musiker,” vol. 1, p. 275:
“We may incidentally refer to a famous jackass of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
newspaper which, as we hear, (for we do not read it,
and flatter ourselves that in this we are not quite
unlike Beethoven) sometimes glances at us, under
its mask, with its dagger-like eyes, and only because
we jokingly suggested that the member of their staff
who wrote about Chopinʼs Don Juan Variations
resembled a bad verse, with a couple of feet too
much, which it was proposed to lop off at leisure.
But why should I recall this to-day, when I have
just come from Chopinʼs F minor Concerto? Beware!
Milk, cool blue milk <i>versus</i> poison. For
what is a whole year of newspapers to a Chopin
concerto? What is master of arts madness to
poetic madness? What are ten editorial crowns to
an <i>adagio</i> in the second concerto?... Chopin
does not present himself with an orchestral army
like the great geniuses, he has only a little cohort,
but this is devoted to him to the last man.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LISZT ON CHOPINʼS CONCERTS.</span>
Chopinʼs friend and brother artist, Franz Liszt,
the greatest pianist of the present century, although
not sharing Schumannʼs unbounded enthusiasm,
always pays due recognition to Chopinʼs talents,
and occasionally the tribute of his supreme admiration.
Speaking of the two Concertos, Chopin would,
he thinks, have preferred greater freedom, but did
violence to the promptings of his genius in order to
conform to the old-fashioned rules of composition.
Liszt says: “These works are distinguished by a
style of rare excellence, and contain passages of
great interest, phrases of astonishing grandeur. Take,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
for example, the <i>Adagio</i> in the second Concerto, for
which he had a decided preference himself, and was
in the habit of frequently performing. The accessory
figures display the composerʼs happiest manner,
while the proportions of the chief phrase of the
fundamental subject are wonderfully grand. This
subject, with a recitative in the minor, forms the
antistrophe. The whole movement is ideally perfect,
now radiant with joy, now melting in pity.”</p>

<p>I feel bound, in conclusion, to supplement the
criticisms of Schumann and Liszt, at that time the
only representatives of the so-called music of the
future, by an opinion formed at the present day,
and unbiased, therefore, by the prejudices and controversies
to which our masterʼs creative genius gave
rise. The younger generation of musicians—and the
pianists in particular—having, in a great measure,
studied Chopin from their early youth, know how to
appreciate him, for we can only truly estimate what
we are thoroughly acquainted with, and which has,
so to speak, become to us a second nature. The
discussion as to Chopinʼs <i>status</i> in the musical world
is over, and his high position assigned to him once
<span class="sidenote">HERMANN SCHOLTZʼS CRITICISM.</span>
for all. It is, however, interesting to read the
criticism of one of the most gifted pianists of the
present day, Hermann Scholtz. In a letter, which I
here quote, he says, speaking of Chopinʼs earliest
compositions:</p>

<p>“In considering these works, we are most astonished
at the great productiveness which he displayed in early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
youth. What a wealth of melody, harmony, and rhythm
appears even in these first compositions! His originality
is marvellous, for at a period when other composers are
more or less dependant on models, with him everything
is new. He is rightly called the creator of a new pianoforte
music; for who before him wrote for the instrument
as he did? in whom do we find such nobility of thought,
such spiritualization of passages? I will merely remind
you of the manner in which he treated the left hand.
His tone-poems in the dance form (especially his
mazurkas and polonaises) receive an unusual charm
from their national colouring.</p>

<p>“Among his weakest compositions are the ‘Rondo,
op. 1,’ ‘Sonata, op. 4,’ and ‘Rondo à la Mazur, op. 5,’
which in form leaves much to be desired, but, by its
melodic charm and grace of feeling, is so irresistably
fascinating that its weaknesses are more than counterbalanced.
Exception might be taken to the instrumentation
of the ‘Cracovienne,’ the Fantasia on Polish
airs, the Variations on ‘Don Juan,’ and the two Concertos,
but on examining the pianoforte part we find it
full of the most beautiful thoughts, besides an unusual
number of passages quite new of their kind and affording
ample opportunity for the display of the pianistʼs
virtuosity. I would particularly mention the <i>Larghetto</i>,
from the second Concerto, a piece full of poetic charm.
In it all the attributes of a perfect work of art appear in
the happiest union: noble melody, choice harmonies,
agreeable figures, and the perfection of form, while the
thoroughly original ideas are finely contrasted. One
thing, indeed, is frequently lacking in Chopinʼs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
compositions—especially in those written in the larger
forms—the thematic work, which is the <i>point dʼappui</i> in
the works of Beethoven and the older masters. In view
of his undeniable excellencies, we readily look with
indulgence on these minor failings in an artist of such
rare imaginative power as Chopin, who, while revealing
to his hearers a new world of thought, is himself, completely
absorbed in the creations of his fancy, for which
reason most of his shorter works give the impression of
an improvisation.</p>

<p>“Chopin gives us his finest and most finished work in
the smallest forms, such as the nocturnes, in which we
see the real enthusiasm of his nature; his studies even
are redolent with poetry. Play numbers 3, 6, 9, 10, and
12 from op. 10, and you cannot fail to agree with me.
I consider the last study (in C minor), with its heroic
character, as the most beautiful in this collection. To
Chopin is due the merit of having first used the broken
chords in a spread-out form, which had formerly been
written only in a close position. To this innovation we
owe a host of interesting figures, as his studies and
concertos abundantly prove. The transposition of the
third and other intervals to a higher octave produces
that agreeable effect which is so captivating in his
music. Chopin may possibly have received a suggestion
from Weber, who used plenty of firm chords in
a scattered position.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS MUSIC.</span>
“One of Chopinʼs special characteristics is the employment
of the diminished chord, especially the chord of
the seventh. This frequently occurs in his mazurkas,
in which, by the enharmonic use of this chord, he accomplishes
a charming return to the chief subject. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
must point out a passage in the Etude in A flat, No. 10,
op. 10, in which, by an enharmonic change of the
ordinary chord of the seventh, the chief melody re-enters
on the chord of the six-four, which produces an effect
quite bewitching. We meet with similar examples in
Schumannʼs Romance (F sharp) and Mendelssohnʼs
‘Songs without Words’ (No. 1, book 2.) Wagner,
also, has turned this modulation to the happiest account
in his newest operas.</p>

<p>“Another of Chopinʼs peculiarities is that he always
repeats the chief thought in a new form, and by
arabesques or fresh harmonization always gives it an
additional interest.”</p>

<p>With such an intellectual equipment, of whose
greatness he was not himself conscious, Chopin went
abroad. Granting that his creative talent developed
in after years, and that he daily gained fresh stores
of knowledge and experience, we still maintain that,
as regards real inspiration, he was never grander or
more independent than in his first works. They
glow with that inimitable youthful fire, which no
one possesses for more than a limited period, but
which produces an unfailing delight and an indelible
impression.</p>

<i>GERMAN AND ITALIAN MUSIC IN THE YEARS
1827—1831. JOHANN MATUSZYNSKI.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="36" height="60" alt="T" /></span>he goal of Chopinʼs travels was Italy, the land
still glorious in fame, the land of love, the
cradle of the arts. In the home of the great masters,
where sweet melodies are heard in every mouth, he
hoped to perfect himself in the practice of his art,
and to gather fresh thoughts for new works.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">POPULARITY OF ITALIAN MUSIC.</span>
In Germany, music had, by the first quarter of the
present century, attained a high position; such men
as Handel, Glück, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and
Weber had enriched the world with masterpieces;
all the larger towns possessed a good opera house,
and the best singers and instrumentalists were heard
in the concert halls. But the <i>repertoires</i> consisted
almost exclusively of Italian music, especially of the
works of that most prolific writer and universal
favourite, Gioacchino Rossini. Mozartʼs operas
were rarely heard: “Der Freischütz” was the only
German opera that had attained any popularity;
“Fidelio” met with so little success that, after one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
performance in Vienna, it was withdrawn, and, as
was then thought, finally.</p>

<p>Beethovenʼs immortal works, however highly <i>connoisseurs</i>
might esteem them, were lying unheeded in
libraries. The <i>chefs dʼorchestres</i>, either from indolence,
personal grudge, or because they were envious of the
master who had surpassed all other composers,
showed little readiness to study his wonderful creations;
besides which, the players of that time were
seldom technically qualified for the difficult task of
adequately rendering Beethovenʼs Symphonies. The
more easily comprehensible music of the Italian
school was received by the public with great <i>gusto</i>,
and only a few isolated voices were heard asking for
deeper and more earnest works.</p>

<p>Although Beethoven had been sleeping three years
in the Währinger churchyard, at Vienna, nothing of
his music was heard beyond an occasional performance
of his larger works at the Vienna “Spirituel
oder Gesellschafts-Concerten,” or the production of
one of the last quartets by Schuppanzigh, who
received but little thanks for his pains.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Beethovenʼs
Sonatas had as completely vanished from the piano
as if they had been buried with their author. By
a considerable section of the public his glorious</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>
<p>Pianoforte Concertos, and the Violin Concerto were
thought wearisome, and almost unplayable; only by
a very small and select minority was the master
sincerely reverenced and warmly admired. Through
their exertions to make his works accessible to the
general public, his fame gradually increased, till,
like the sun long struggling through its clouds, it
shone over the whole civilised world.</p>

<p>How often must the master have been cut to the
heart at seeing how small was the number of those
who understood him, and how many of his countrymen
exclusively preferred Italian music. But every
lofty genius is aware of the real measure of its own
greatness: mediocre ability over-estimates itself,
great talent knows what are its capacities, but
genius despite much or long misunderstanding, and
uninfluenced by praise or blame, goes on its way,
trusting to the voice within which ever and again
cries, “your time is coming.”</p>

<p>Beethoven made no secret of his opinions, and,
regardless of giving offence, spoke out plainly against
the French and Italian music of his day. To this
Schindler, in his Biography of Beethoven, refers as
follows: “At the beginning of the third decade of
the present century, when the flood of Italian music
was at its height, Beethoven was one day conversing
with some friends on the almost desperate prospects
of musical art, when we heard him say decisively,
‘But they cannot deprive me of my place in the
history of art.’” This clearly shows that sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
confidence about the future consoled him for the
lack of present success.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances the generality of compositions
were, of course, of an insipid kind, designed
only for external effect. The famous pianists of the
day—Field, Cramer, Klengel (pupils of Clementi),
and Hummel (pupil of Dionys Weber)<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>—gradually
disappeared from the scene of the triumphs of Field
as a <i>virtuoso</i>, and of Hummel as a composer and
tasteful player. Among a younger generation of
musicians, Kalkbrenner bore the palm; after him
came Moscheles, Herz, Thalberg, and Mendelsohn.
Liszt had not made a name till some years later.
Felix Mendelssohn had attracted attention by his
instrumental works, but his fame was then merely
in the bud. Franz Schubert<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> was only known in
Vienna and Prague as a song-writer. In Vienna,
where he was born and lived for the whole of his
short life, people knew nothing, or cared nothing,
about his C major Symphony.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">AN ATTEMPTED MUSICAL REFORM.</span>
A little band of true lovers of art, men to whom
music was something sacred, strove to bring about
a reform, and shrunk not from material sacrifices in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>the cause of earnest music. Deeming the encouragement
of young and struggling artists a <i>desideratum</i>
they offered prizes for the best symphony, which
were competed for from time to time, as, in 1834,
when Lachner won the first prize. Attracted by
the honour and pecuniary advantages there was
no lack of competitors, but although most of the
compositions displayed knowledge, industry, and
conscientious work, none of them were illumined by
the immortal spark of genius. It was at length perceived
that no amount of prize-giving would produce
genius, or even talent; that the true musician, like
the poet, must be <i>born</i>; and the scheme was
abandoned.</p>

<p>The German masters of that day were more
successful in the domain of opera than in that of
symphony; Winterʼs “Das unterbrochene Opferfest,”
Weiglʼs “Schweizerfamilie,” Spohrʼs “Jessonda,”
“Azor und Zemire,” and “Faust,” were
favourably received for upwards of twenty years.
Of Kreutzerʼs works, “Das Nachtlager von Granada”
has alone been preserved, of Marschnerʼs (the greatest
opera composer of the three we have mentioned)
“Der Templar und die Judin” and “Hans Heiling”
have remained on the stage. Lortzing, a writer of
comic operas, came out later, as also did Flotow.
Meyerbeer, whose “Robert le Diable,” and “Les
Huguenots” have now been over the whole world,
had then, with the exception of his “Ritter des
Kreuzes,” only written operas for the Italian stage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
but had been unable to compete with the highly-admired
Rossini.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PAGANINIʼS PLAYING.</span>
Italy could no longer boast illustrious <i>virtuosi</i> like
Corelli, Tartini, Viotti, Scarlatti, and Clementi,
whose genius had attracted the eyes of all Europe;
but she possessed a Paganini, the greatest violinist
of the century, as Catalini was the greatest singer.
Spohr, in his autobiography, says a great deal
in disparagement of Paganini, not, indeed, from
jealousy, for, being himself one of the greatest
violinists musical history can produce, he adhered
as closely to the principles of the Classic School as
Paganini did to those of the Romantic. Those who
heard them both say, that although they could not
but admire Spohr, he never carried them away with
the same force, or produced such a deep undying
impression as Paganini.</p>

<p>In 1829, Paganini appeared at several concerts in
Warsaw, and Chopin was entranced by his playing.
He never ceased to speak with enthusiasm of the
Paganini evenings, which seemed to carry him out
of the real world into a land of happy dreams.</p>

<p>Lipinski,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> who had made Paganiniʼs acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>at Piacenza, met him again in Warsaw, and the two
artists greeted each other with the sincerest pleasure.
In spite of all the honour paid to the great Italian,
it was felt that Polish patriotism was in question,
and this showed itself very warmly. A competition
was proposed, which the two artists accepted; they
each played their favourite pieces in turn, and concluded
with a double Concerto by Kreutzer,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> amid
frantic shouts of applause.</p>

<p>The modesty of Chopinʼs character and his freedom
from jealousy appear from a remark which he
made on this occasion, “If I were such a pianist as
Paganini is a violinist I should like to engage in a
similar competition with a pianist of equal powers.”
That evening he made up his mind to pay a long
visit to Paganiniʼs fatherland; no less did the singers
attract him “to the land where the citrons bloom,”
for Italy had at that day a more brilliant array of
vocal artists than any country in Europe. The
mild climate of those happy regions is favourable to
the development of fine voices; but the Italian singing
masters understand also the art of bringing out
the voice to the best advantage.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ITALIAN MUSIC.</span>
The Italian composers, Rossini, Mercadente,
Vaccai, Bellini, and Donizetti wrote excellently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
for the voice, but they not only required a fine,
rich organ, but an artistic culture, such as in these
days, unfortunately, is rare. What a stimulus to
fresh effort Chopin hoped to receive from hearing
Rubini, Mario, Galli, Lablache, Tamburin, Pasta,
Judith, Grusi, and Palazzesi!</p>

<p>In Poland, Italian opera was considered the finest
in the world. Every great city, like London, Paris,
Vienna, St. Petersburg, or Stockholm, had an Italian
opera house; even in such cities as Dresden and
Münich there was an Italian as well as a German
opera, or at least Italian singers were engaged
besides German ones.</p>

<p>Had Chopin gone to Italy his playing would undoubtedly
have captivated a people so sensitive to
artistic beauty, and it is possible that the voice of
praise might have rendered him insensible to other
influences; but as a mere listener he had been
learning to admire, and criticise the achievements of
others.</p>

<p>Mozart, to whom Chopin looked up with reverence,
had visited Italy when fourteen years of age, and won
great triumphs as a pianist, but as soon as he had
heard the glorious voices and perfect vocalization of
the operatic singers, he felt stirred by the desire of
writing an opera. In 1770, he composed “Midritate
Rè di Ponta,” and the success of this work made
him resolve to devote his energies thenceforth more
especially to the stage. In no other country could
a composer attain such operatic triumphs; the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of a new and well-received opera ran like wild-fire
from town to town, and the fame of a young composer
spread from the Italian cities over the whole
world.</p>

<p>Meyerbeer also began his career as a pianist, and
as such achieved a brilliant success. Salieri, hearing
him improvise at Vienna, at once discerned his
ability, and said to him, “What are you going to
do? Go to Italy, and study the operatic style, and
the Italian method of singing.” Through the
influence of his wealthy family, Meyerbeerʼs first
operatic attempts had been produced at the Royal
Theatre in Berlin, but had excited little interest.
To the somewhat dispirited young writer, Salieriʼs
advice seemed very acceptable. He acted upon it,
and when he had been some months in Milan, wrote
an operetta, which had a very favourable reception.
After an interval of a year he produced the “Crociato
in Egitto,” which carried the name of Meyerbeer all
over Italy. Although not quite twenty years of age,
the doors of the Royal Academy of Music in Paris
were opened to him, and they were the key to those
of the entire musical world.</p>

<p>Many of Chopinʼs friends and admirers used to
say, “Our Frederic will do likewise, and become a
first rate operatic composer.” For him, however, a
different though a still splendid destiny was in store.
The non-fulfilment of these expectations, to which
his rare musical gifts had given rise, may be explained
by external circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">WHY HE DID NOT WRITE AN OPERA.</span>
It seems at first sight a matter of surprise that
Chopin did not produce one dramatic work during
his many yearsʼ residence in Paris, where there is
such an abundance of good models and first-rate
artists; besides which there was at that time not
only the Grand Opera, but the Comic and Italian
operas. But no one fully acquainted with the
circumstances will be astonished that, in Paris,
Chopin should have held aloof from the stage. In
Italy, a new opera can be mounted without much
expense, for the public care little about costumes
and scenery. They attend the opera solely for the
music; if this finds favour and the singers are good
a new work may be performed, several nights in
succession, and the fortune of the composer is made.
But in Paris a new opera necessitates a large outlay,
besides which—and particularly in the case of a
foreigner—a famous reputation and influential patronage
are requisite for the acceptance of any great
operatic work. The Parisians demand a mounting
at once tasteful and gorgeous, and every opera—whatever
the excellence of the music—must include
some brilliant dances in order to produce a due
effect. Otherwise a <i>fiasco</i> may be predicted with
something like certainty.</p>

<p>When Chopin settled in Paris he had to take
thought for means of subsistence, in order to render
needless any further pecuniary sacrifices on the part
of his parents. In spite of his masterly skill he did
not find it easy to gain a footing in a city, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
there were already many pianists of talent and
celebrity. In the winter famous performers from
all parts of Europe resorted to the capital of the
continent to let their light shine before the leaders of
fashion. To keep abreast of such competitors Chopin
was compelled to study continuously, and only a
<i>virtuoso</i> knows what this means. Neither could he
abandon society, although this would have been
better for his delicate health. If he could have
lived according to his inclinations as a composer,
not as an executant, and a Scribe had written a
libretto for him, an opera might then have been
included among his productions in Paris.</p>

<p>But we have been anticipating and must return
to our artist, whose beautiful, dreamy eyes beamed
with delight as he thought of Italy, the ideal land of
his imagination. He was subject, of course, to seasons
of depression, and yearning after his beloved family,
for his was not one of those superficial natures which
soon forgets what is not before its eyes. He thought
fondly of parents and sisters, and of his adored
Constantia with all the passionate ardour of his
poetic soul. Her sweet voice was ever ringing in his
ears, and in his dreams he saw her eyes suffused
with tears; while the ring which she had slipped on
his finger at parting was his dearest jewel. His
letters to his confidential friend, Johann Matuszynski,
show how noble and fervent was his love, yet
Constantiaʼs name never once appears in his
letters to his family, from whom he kept secret his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
attachment. He used earnestly to beg his friend to
send him frequent news of his “angel of peace,”
as he called his Constantia, that he might not
perish with longing and unrest.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">JOHANN MATUSZYNSKI</span> As this friend faithfully fulfilled what was required
of him, a brief reference may be made to his life.
Johann Matuszynski was born in Warsaw, December
9th, 1809, and, after passing through the Lyceum,
went to the University to study medicine. At the
end of six terms of diligent study, he was appointed
regimental surgeon in 1830, just when the war of
freedom broke out in Poland. Four years later he
graduated at Tübingen, and received the diploma of
doctor of medicine and surgery. At the same time
he wrote a treatise on “Plica Polonica,” which was
highly commended. He next went to Paris, where
he immediately visited his friend Chopin, whom he
had not seen for five years. They had been schoolfellows
at the Lyceum, and as the doctor was an
excellent flautist they had as boys played duets
together. A weakness of the chest obliged Matuszynski,
in after years, to abandon his instrument.</p>

<p>In Paris he soon attracted the attention of the
first physicians, and, what for a foreigner is very
rare, was made professor at the “Ecole de Médicine.”
Proud of this position, he devoted himself to his
profession with an assiduity injurious to his delicate
health, and he died of consumption, April 20th,
1842.</p>

<img src="images/a.jpg" width="37" height="60" alt="I" /></span>T Kaliz, where Frederic met his friend and
travelling companion, Titus Woyciechowski,
he was the guest of the physician, Dr. Kelbich.
That most agreeable man requested him to give a
concert in the little town, but the young artist
declined, not being satisfied with the orchestra.</p>

<p>At the present day, a famous pianoforte <i>virtuoso</i>
like Chopin would not concern himself about the
orchestra, but unhesitatingly perform the longest
programme, without the assistance of any other
artists. Then, however, pianists rarely played less
than two pieces with orchestral accompaniment;
they engaged the co-operation of other musicians,
partly from a respect for art, partly for the sake of
offering the public more variety.</p>

<p>Chopin declared that it was impossible to play the
whole evening, and as soon as Woyciechowski
arrived, he bade a grateful farewell to his hospitable
host and pursued his journey. The friends stopped
at Breslau, from whence Chopin wrote as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Breslau, November, 9th, 1830.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My beloved Parents and Sisters,</span></p>

<p>We arrived here very comfortably on Saturday
evening, at six, in bright pleasant autumn weather.
We put up at the Hotel “Zur Goldenen Gans,” and,
as soon as we had dressed and taken some refreshment,
we went to the theatre, where Raimundʼs
“Alpine King” was being performed. You will see
the piece some day. The public admired the scenery
more than we did. I thought the acting pretty good.
The day before yesterday “Maurer and Schlosser”
was given, but not in first-rate style. To-day I shall
hear the “Interrupted Sacrifice;” I am quite curious
to see how it will turn out. There is a want of good
singers here, but then the theatre is very cheap; a
place in the pit only costs two Polish gulden.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">MUSIC AT BRESLAU.</span>
Breslau pleases me much better this time than
last. I have delivered Sowinskiʼs letter, but have
scarcely seen him yet, for we were unfortunately out
when he called. We had first gone to the <i>Ressource</i>,
where, by invitation of the conductor, Schnabel, I
was present at the rehearsal for the concert in the
evening. There are three concerts a week.</p>

<p>As is often the case at rehearsals, there was a very
poor orchestra; a certain Referendar Hellwig was
going to perform Moschelesʼ E flat major Concerto.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>Before this gentleman sat down, Schnabel, who had
not heard me for four years, asked me to try the
piano. I could not refuse this request, and played
some Variations. Schnabel overwhelmed me with
expressions of praise and pleasure. This made
Hellwig feel a little uneasy, and I was pressed to
take his place in the evening. Schnabel threw his
influence into the scale, and asked me so heartily,
that I could not deny the dear old man his wish.
He is a great friend of Herr Elsnerʼs, which means
much to me; but I told Schnabel at once that I only
played for his sake, that for weeks I had not touched
an instrument, and that it was not part of my programme
to play in Breslau. Schnabel replied, that
he was well aware of that, but that when he saw me
in church, yesterday, he wished to ask me, but did
not venture to do so. What could I do? So I went
back to the hotel with his son to fetch my music,
and played the Romance and Rondo from the second
Concerto.</p>

<p>The Germans admired my playing at the rehearsal.
“What a light touch he has,” I heard them whisper;
but about the composition I did not catch a syllable.
Titus, whose ears are everywhere, and who is always
active on my behalf, heard one gentleman say,
“there is no doubt that this young man can play,
but he cannot compose.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the <i>table dʼhôte</i>, I made the acquaintance
of a very amiable-looking gentleman, who was
sitting opposite me. In the course of conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
I discovered that his name was Scharff, that he
knew Scholtz, of Warsaw, well, and was on friendly
terms with the gentlemen to whom I had letters of
introduction. This Herr Scharff was wonderfully
kind and obliging to Titus and myself. He took us
all over Breslau, went with us to the suburbs of the
town, wrote down our names as guests at the
<i>Ressource</i>, and procured us visitorsʼ tickets for the
concert yesterday, which he sent before the rehearsal.
How astonished this friendly gentleman, and his
companion who had obtained the tickets, must have
been, when they beheld in one of the strangers the
chief personage in the performance.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PLAYS AT A CONCERT.</span>
Besides playing the Rondo, I improvised, for the
sake of the connoisseurs, on a theme from the “Mutes
of Portice.” There was an overture, and some
dancing to conclude with. Schnabel wanted to
regale me with a sumptuous supper, but I only
took a cup of broth.</p>

<p>Of course I have made the acquaintance of the
chief organist in Breslau, Herr Köhler; he promised
to show me his organ. I met, also, a certain Baron
Nesse di Neisse, a great violin player and a pupil of
Spohrʼs.</p>

<p>Another musician resident here, a Herr Hesse,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>was also very complimentary to me; but none of the
Germans, except Schnabel, whose face beams with
real delight, and who claps me on the shoulder every
moment, quite know what to make of me.</p>

<p>Titus took delight in watching what went on
around. As I have not yet got a name, people could
not make up their minds whether to praise or to
blame me, and connoisseurs were not quite certain
whether my music was really good, or only seemed
so. A gentleman came up to me and praised the
form, as something quite new. I donʼt know his
name, but I think of all my listeners he understood
me the best.</p>

<p>Schnabel placed a carriage at my disposal in the
kindest manner; but when the dancing began, about
ten, we went quietly home. I am truly glad that I
was able to give pleasure to the dear old man.</p>

<p>After the concert, Schnabel introduced me to a
lady who is considered the first pianist in Breslau.
She thanked me very much for the “delightful surprise,”
as she expressed it, but regretted, exceedingly,
that I would not make up my mind to appear in
public.</p>

<p>The Referendar consoled himself, and sang—though
very indifferently—Figaroʼs air from the
“Barbiere di Sevilla.”</p>

<p>A great deal was said about Elsner, yesterday, and
his Echo Variations for the orchestra were much
praised. I said that they could only judge what
a composer Elsner was after hearing his Coronation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Mass. We leave for Dresden to-morrow at two
oʼclock. I kiss and embrace you. My kindest
remembrances to Messrs. Eisner, Zywny, Matuszynski,
Kolberg, Marylski, and Witwicki.</p>

<p class="right">Your FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Dresden, November 14th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I have scarcely found a moment yet to write you a
few words. I have just come from a dinner at which
the company were all Poles. I have crept away to
write to you, for the post goes at seven, and I should
much like to see the “Mutes of Portici,” at the
Theatre.</p>

<p>We quitted Breslau unwillingly; the society of
the gentlemen to whom Scholtz had given us letters
of introduction made our sojourn in the capital of
Silesia very agreeable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ARRIVAL IN DRESDEN.</span>
My first visit in Dresden was to Fräulein Pechwell.
She played, on Friday, at a Musical <i>Soirée</i> at
Councillor Kressigʼs, and procured an <i>entrée</i> for
me. The “Mutes” was to be performed the same
evening at the theatre. The choice was difficult;
but one must always be polite to ladies, so I decided
for the <i>Soirée</i>. Another important reason with me
was, that Signora Palazzesi,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> the <i>prima donna</i> of the
Italian opera, was expected to be there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>After making a very careful toilet, I had a Sedan
chair fetched, got into the queer, comfortable box,
and was carried to the house where the musical
entertainment was to take place. The spirit of
mischief seized me, and I felt a desire to stamp
through the bottom of the chair; however, I
forebore.</p>

<p>Arrived at Kressigʼs abode, I sent up my name to
Fräulein Pechwell, whereupon the master of the
house appeared, received me with many compliments,
and led me into a room where a number
of ladies were sitting at eight large tables. No
flashing of diamonds met my gaze, but the more
modest glitter of a host of steel knitting needles,
which moved ceaselessly in the hands of these
industrious ladies.</p>

<p>The number of ladies and of needles was so large
that if the ladies had purposed an attack upon the
gentlemen, the latter would have been in a
sorry plight. The only resource left them would
have been to have made weapons of their spectacles,
of which there were as many as there were bald
heads.</p>

<p>The clatter of knitting needles and tea cups was
suddenly interrupted by music from the adjoining
room. The overture to “Fra Diavolo” was played
first; then Signora Palazzesi sang, in a magnificent
voice, clear as a bell, and with plenty of bravura. I
presented myself to the songstress, which gave me
an opportunity of speaking also to the Musical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Director, Rastrelli,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> who had accompanied her.
With true artistic politeness Rastrelli introduced
me to Signor Rubini, who, with much affability,
promised me a letter to his brother, the famous
tenor. I do not need anything more for Milan.
Yesterday, Rubini kindly took me to the Catholic
Church, where a mass was being performed of
Morlacchiʼs (bandmaster here.) This refined and
agreeable man remembered me at once, and, giving
me a place beside him, talked to me a long time.
At these Vespers I heard the two celebrated Neapolitan
soprani, Sassaroli and Tarquinio; the violin
obligato was played by the bandmaster, the incomparable
Rolla, to whom Soliva had given me a
recommendation. Rolla received me very pleasantly,
and said he would give me a letter to his father, the
opera director in Milan.</p>

<p>After hearing Fräulein Pechwell play at the
musical <i>soirée</i>, I quietly slipped away to the opera;
but only arrived at the commencement of the fifth
act, so refrain from any criticism. I shall hear it all
this evening.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">KIND RECEPTION FROM THE ARTISTS.</span>
As I was going at the Dresden visiting hour, to
call on Klengel, I met him in front of his house.
He knew me directly, and welcomed me with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>heart-felt politeness. I have a great respect for him.
Klengel asked me where I lived, and begged me to
come and see him early the next day, as he could
not go back with me then. He advised me to play
in public, but I told him, in as friendly a way as I
could, that I should not be here long enough for
that. I donʼt think Dresden would bring me either
much fame, or much money, and I have no time
to spare.</p>

<p>General Kniaziewicz, whom I saw at Frau Pruszakʼs,
talked about a concert, but thought with me
that I should make little by it.</p>

<p>Yesterday I heard “Tancred,” but could not, on the
whole, praise the performance. Rollaʼs marvellous
solo, and the song by Fräulein von Hähnel, of the
Vienna Royal Opera Theatre, had to make up for
the shortcomings of the rest. The King, with his
court, were present; they were, the same morning,
at the service in the church, where a mass, by Baron
Miltitz, was performed, under the direction of Morlacchi.
The voices of Messrs. Sassarole, Muschetti,
Babnigg, and Zezi sounded magnificent. I cannot
call the composition original, but well worked out;
the royal chamber musicians, Dotzaceer and Rummer,
celebrated violincellists, played their solos very
finely.</p>

<p>I know none of the chief artists intimately, except
dear Klengel, to whom I am sure to play to-morrow.
I like to talk to Klengel, for one always learns
something from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>I saw the Green Arch when I was here before,
and once is enough for me; but I have visited the
Picture Gallery again with the greatest interest; if
I lived here I should go every week; there are
pictures in it, the sight of which makes me fancy
I hear music. Good bye for to-day.</p>

<p class="right">Your FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Prague, November 21st, 1830.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE WEEK AT DRESDEN</span>
The week at Dresden slipped away so quickly that
I hardly noticed how it went. I used to leave my
hotel in the best of spirits in the morning, and did
not return till night. When Klengel came to know
me better as a musician, that is, when I had played
my Concerto to him, he said that my playing
strongly reminded him of Field, that my touch was
quite unique, and that, although he had already
heard much about me, he had not thought that I
was such a <i>virtuoso</i>.</p>

<p>I saw—and why should I be ashamed of it?—with
pleasure, that these were sincere compliments; and
he gave me a practical proof of their being so, for
scarcely had I left him when he went to Malacchi,
and to Councillor von Lüttichau, who is director
general of the Royal drama, to find out whether, if I
stayed four days longer in Dresden, I could give a
concert without any very burdensome preparations.
Klengel assured me afterwards that he did not do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>this for me, but for Dresden, and that he should like
to force me into giving a concert. He came to me
the next morning and said, that he had taken all the
necessary steps, but that there was no evening disengaged
till next Sunday (this was Wednesday.)
The first performance of “Fra Diavolo” was fixed
for Friday, and Rossiniʼs “La Donna del Lago,” in
Italian, for Saturday.</p>

<p>I gave Klengel a hearty welcome, for, indeed, I
feel as if I had known him for years, and he seems
to feel the same towards me; he asked for the score
of my Concerto, and took me with him to the <i>soirée</i>
at Frau Niesiolowskaʼs. I also called on Frau
Szczerbinin, but I had stayed so long at Frau
Niesiolowskaʼs that by the time I arrived the company
had gone. I was, therefore, asked to dinner
the next day. In the afternoon I went, by invitation,
to see Countess Dobrzycka, who is head
governess to Princess Augusta.</p>

<p>The countess was celebrating her birthday, and I
had scarcely offered my congratulations, when two
Saxon Princesses entered: Princess Augusta, only
daughter of the late King Frederic Augustus, surnamed
“the Just,” and Princess Maximilian, neé
Princess of Lucca, daughter-in-law of the present
King, a pleasant young lady.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LETTERS FOR ITALY.</span>
I played before these ladies, whereupon letters
were promised me for Italy, which showed that my
playing must have pleased them. Two letters were
in fact sent to my hotel the next day; the Countess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Dobrzycka will send the others after me to Vienna.
I gave her my address there. The letters were
addressed to the Queen of the Sicilies, at Naples,
and Princess Ellasino, at Rome. Letters of recommendation
were also promised me to the reigning
Duchess of Lucca, and the Viceroy of Milan, which
I was to receive through the kind care of Kraszewski.</p>

<p>Klengel has just given me a letter to Vienna,
where he thinks of going himself bye and bye. At
Frau Niesiolowskaʼs he drank my health in champagne.
The lady of the house teased me a good
deal, and insisted on always calling me “Szopski.”</p>

<p>Rolla is a first-rate violinist, as anyone who knows
anything about violin playing must admit.</p>

<p>Goodbye till you hear from Vienna, which we
hope to reach by nine on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>I pleased General Kniaziewicz very much; he told
me that no other pianist had made such an agreeable
impression on him; I tell you this because I
know you will like to hear it.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, December 1st, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I was greatly delighted with your letter, my

<p>“The Wild Man”—as the capital Restaurant

kreuzers for an excellently prepared fritter; what
more would you wish?</p>

<p>Titus was full of joy too, for he received letters
from his family. I thank Celinski for the accompanying
note; it vividly recalled the time when I
was still among you; it seemed to me as if I were
sitting at the piano, and Celinski standing opposite
to me, looking at M. Zwyny, who had just offered
Linowski a pinch of snuff. Only Materszynski was
wanting to complete the group. Has he recovered
from the fever yet?</p>

<p>I must say that there are many charming girls in
Vienna.</p>

<p>Haslinger received me very kindly, although he
would print neither the Sonata, nor the second
Variations, but he shall repent this.</p>

<p>I learned, also, from Haslinger that Fräulein
Blahetka is in Stuttgart with her parents, and that,
perhaps, she will not come back at all this winter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PLEASANT LODGINGS IN VIENNA.</span>
I have taken lodgings with Titus in one of the
principal streets, close to the vegetable market.
For three elegant rooms on the third floor, we pay
fifty gulden a month, which is considered cheap here.
An English Admiral is occupying them at present,
but he leaves to-day. Admiral! And I am admired.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
So the house is a desirable one, especially as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
mistress, a handsome, widowed baroness, still young,
has been—as she says—for some time in Poland,
and heard of me in Warsaw. She knew the family
Skarzynski had moved in good society, and asked
Titus if he did not know a beautiful young lady of
the name of Rembielinska.</p>

<p>The presence of this charming and intelligent lady
makes the apartments all the more agreeable, for she
likes Poles, and being a Prussian she regards the
Austrians with no great favour.</p>

<p>As soon as we go in Graff, the pianoforte-maker,
will send us an instrument. When I went to see
my friend Würfel, he began to talk immediately
about arrangements for a concert. He is a remarkable
man; although too ill to go out he gives lessons
at his house. He spits blood, which has weakened
him very much, and yet he talks of a concert. The
poor sufferer told me that the newspapers here wrote
enthusiastically about my F minor Concerto, which
I had not the remotest expectation of. So I shall give
a concert, but when, where, how and what, I do not
in the least know.</p>

<p>The change of air has given me a swollen nose,
which hindered me from presenting myself at the
Prussian Ambassadorʼs hotel, or at Countess Rzeiouskaʼs,
the <i>rendezvous</i> of all the “haute voleé.”
This lady lives next to Hussarzewskiʼs, where, in
spite of my nose, I have already been two or three
times. He is of the same opinion as Würfel,
who advised me to play without honorarium. Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>Malfatti<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> welcomed me as warmly as if I had been
a relation. When he read my name on my visiting
card, he hastened to me, embraced me, and said,
that Herr Wladislaw Ostrowski had written to him
about me, and that if he could be of any service he
was ready to do anything for me. He said, besides,
that he would present me to Madame Tatzszczew,
the Russian Ambassadorʼs wife, and would manage
the necessary introductions; the Court was unfortunately
in mourning for the King of Naples,
but he would do what was possible. He also
promised to introduce me to Baron Dunoi, director
of the Musical Society here, who would probably be
most useful to me.</p>

<p>Elsnerʼs letter of recommendation to Herr Mittag
procured me another equally agreeable acquaintance,
who took a lively interest in me, and seems to be a
person of influence.</p>

<p>I have been to see Czerny, who was as polite as
ever, and asked, “Have you been studying diligently?”
He has arranged another Overture for
eight pianos and sixteen players, and seems very
happy about it.</p>

<p>Except Czerny, I have seen none of the pianists
this time. I have been twice to Frau Weyberheim,
Frau Wolfʼs sister. I am invited to the <i>soirée</i> there
to-morrow, “en petit cercle des amateurs.” I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
pay a visit afterwards to Countess Rosalie Rzewuska,
who receives between nine and ten. Hussarzewski
has informed her that I am coming; I shall meet
the celebrated Frau Cibini,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> for whom Moscheles
wrote a duet sonata.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went with my letters to Stametzʼs
counting-house, and was received just as if I had
come for money. He handed me a paper, which
notified that I was to go to the police with my card
of permission to stay, and—basta. But perhaps it
will be different bye and bye.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ADVISED NOT TO GIVE A CONCERT.</span>
I was also at Banker Geymüllerʼs yesterday,
where Titus has to receive his 6,000 Polish gulden.
When he had read my name Herr Geymüller, without
taking any further notice of the letter, said, it
was very agreeable to him to become acquainted
with an artist of such distinction as myself; but he
could not advise me to give a concert here, as there
were very many good pianists in the city, and a
great reputation was requisite to make money.
Finally, he remarked, “I cannot help you in any
way, the times are too bad.”</p>

<p>I listened with big eyes to this edifying discourse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>and when it was over I replied, that I was not at
all sure whether it would pay to make a public
appearance, for I had not yet called upon any
influential people, not even on the Russian Ambassador,
to whom I had a letter from the Grand
Prince Constantine.</p>

<p>At that, Herr Geymüller suddenly changed his
tactics; but I took my leave, regretting that I had
robbed him of his precious time, and thought to
myself, “Wait you ... Jew.”</p>

<p>I have not been to the bandmaster, Lachner, yet,
as I have not room enough to receive return visits.</p>

<p>We went from the “City of London,” where we
had a long bill to pay, to the “Golden Lamb,” in
Leopold Street, where we are still, hoping that the
Englishman will quit the Baronessʼs rooms to-day.
“As soon as we are in our own house,” says Titus,
who always tries to make me assume the position
of the haughty patron, “we will introduce an
aristocratic <i>ton</i>. Then,” he continued, “we will
receive, have music, and arrange for concerts—but
not gratuitous ones.”</p>

<p>I have not yet visited Madame Raayek, Frau von
Elkau, Rothschild, the Vogts, and various other
interesting people. To-day I am going to the
Embassy, where I hope to see Baron Meindorf,
whom I shall ask for first, on Hussarzewskiʼs
advice, for Baron Meindorf will tell me when I
can best present myself to Herr Tatyszezew.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">OPERA IN VIENNA.</span>
I have not touched the money which I had from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the banker the day before yesterday. I mean to
be very careful of it. I am sorry, my dear parents,
but I must ask you to send me something more
at the end of the month for the journey to Italy,
in case my concerts turn out badly. The theatre
is my heaviest expense; but this I regret the less
as Fräulein Heinefetter<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> and Herr Wildt<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> sing
nearly every evening, and are excellent beyond all
description. This week I have heard three entirely
new operas: “Fra Diavolo” yesterday, three days
ago “Titus,” and to-day “William Tell.” I certainly
prefer “The Mutes of Portici” to “Fra
Diavolo.”</p>

<p>I do not envy Orlowski<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> because he accompanies
Lafont. Will the time come when Lafont shall
accompany me? Does the question seem presumptuous?
But if God wills it may come to
pass.</p>

<p>Nidecki thinks of staying here the whole winter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>All this week I have done nothing but take care
of my nose, go to the opera and to Graffʼs. I play
every afternoon to get my stiff fingers into working
order. I do not know how this week has flown. I
have, as yet, taken no definite steps towards a
concert. <i>A propos</i> of that, do you advise me to play
the F minor or E minor concerto? Würfel thinks
my F minor concerto more beautiful than Hummelʼs
in A flat major, which has just been published by
Haslinger. Herr Haslinger is shrewd, trying in a
cautious, subtle way, to induce me to let him have
my compositions gratis. Klengel was surprised
that he gave me nothing for the variations. Perhaps
Haslinger thinks that if he treats my works as
<i>bagatelles</i>, I shall be only too glad to get them
printed; but the time for gratuitous work is over
with me; now it is, pay <i>bestie</i>.</p>

<p>Graff advised me to choose the States Deputies
Hall, where the “Spirituel” concerts are given, as
the nicest and best place for my concert. But I
must first obtain the permission of Count Dietrichstein,
which, indeed, will not be difficult through
Malfatti.</p>

<p>I am as strong as a lion, and they say I am
stouter. Altogether I am doing well, and I hope,
through God, who sent Malfatti to be a help to
me—oh, splendid Malfatti—that I shall do still
better.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">
<i>THE INSURRECTION IN WARSAW, AND ITS
DISASTROUS EFFECT ON CHOPINʼS SOJOURN IN
VIENNA.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 36px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="36" height="60" alt="T" /></span>he tyrannical rule and the capricious and despotic
temper of the Grand Prince Constantine, which
the nation had borne with indescribable patience and
meekness for fifteen years, at length led to a revolution.
The Constitution framed for Poland at the
Vienna Congress was regarded in St. Petersburg and
Moscow as the work of an encroaching Western
Liberalism, and as a revolutionary form of government
which threatened to shake the stability of the
Russian monarchy. It was, therefore, the constant
aim of statesmen on the Neva to circumscribe this
hateful Constitution, to make it as far as possible a
dead letter, and, finally, to oppress Poland to the
uttermost. For the accomplishment of these ends,
the advisers of the Czar conceived the idea of
sending his brother, the Grand Prince Constantine
Pawlowicz, to Warsaw, as plenipotentiary and military
governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>In St. Petersburg, the character of this cruel,
coarse man had caused the Emperor numberless
embarrassments; for the higher State functionaries
found him unbearable.</p>

<p>With the title of commander-in-chief of the whole
Polish army, Prince Constantine received unlimited
power of life and death over the soldiers. He had,
at the same time, full authority over all the officials
of the kingdom; practically, the Constitution ceased
to exist; as early as the year 1819, the freedom of
the press had been withdrawn, and a strict censorship
established.</p>

<p>When the appointed time arrived, the Diet was
not convoked, and faithful patriots who dared to
express their opinions were imprisoned. The country
swarmed with spies, whose business was to persecute
and punish those who showed the least sign
of a desire for freedom. Not only the actions, but
the half-whispered words, and even the thoughts
of the people were betrayed to the Government.
Especial severity was exercised towards the young,
whom for their natural love of liberty and resistance
to despotism the Grand Prince hated with all his
heart.</p>

<p>To enforce obedience, the most harsh and unjust
means were employed, which could not but embitter
the people. The long-cherished wish of Constantine
was that the Polish youth should wear a uniform, be
enlisted in the army, and thus become the obedient
tools of his tyranny. Every young man who devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
himself to science, literature, or the fine arts, instead
of entering the army, was, in his eyes, as also in
those of the ever vigilant police, either a foolish
fanatic, or dangerous to the State. From such proceedings
a revolution could not fail, sooner or later,
to ensue.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">OUTBREAK OF THE REVOLUTION.</span>
Inflamed by the example of the July revolution
in Paris, the Polish youth, whom Constantine hated
so intensely, instigated the insurrection of November
29th, 1830. The army and the whole nation followed
the revolutionary banners, for all classes were equally
incensed against the tyrannical government of the
Grand Prince.</p>

<p>At the first news of disquietude in Poland, Titus
Woyciechowski at once left Vienna to enter the
army. Frederic wished to do the same, as he
thought that in such circumstances he could not
endure to be so far from his family and friends, and
he was only prevented from doing so by the entreaties
of his parents, who knew that their sonʼs
health was not fit for the hardships of war. Chopinʼs
family were naturally undesirous that he should cut
short the artistic career on which he had just entered
at so much cost, and in which he had already
achieved good success. But his anxiety about his
parents and sisters was so great that he followed his
friend by the extra post, and had he overtaken him,
he would certainly have gone back to Warsaw.
Returned to Vienna, Chopin yielded to his fatherʼs
will, and resumed the idea of giving a concert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>This, however, was not so speedily arranged.
The interest of the Viennese musicians had waxed
somewhat faint, and he had no benevolent or
influential friends among the newly-arrived artists.
When he played gratuitously help was readily
forthcoming; but the case was altered now, and
Frederic saw himself neglected. It is not impossible,
in the time of Metternich, that people
kept aloof from Poles from motives of prudence;
and the energy necessary for overcoming all these
obstacles failed Chopin.</p>

<p>Some of his former acquaintances were ill, others
had gone away, and the rest were afraid that the
agreeable, educated, and highly-gifted artist might
settle in Vienna, and thus become a dangerous rival.
Many even were displeased at his success in the
drawing rooms. The rapid succession of military
events in Poland frightened most of his patrons
from serving him, while his own mind was more
occupied with politics than music.</p>

<p>Several of Fredericʼs letters, written in a spirit
of patriotic enthusiasm, were destroyed by his
parents, in case they should fall into the hands of
the Russian Government, which had even instituted
domiciliary visits. In consequence of the war,
much that he wrote never reached Warsaw at all.
The sad condition of his country made a deep and
lasting impression on the mind of the young artist,
so sensitive alike to happiness and sorrow. The
gay, buoyant tone of his letters, which had formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
so delighted their recipients, changed to a certain
discontent and sadness; even his pleasant wit, as
the reader will see by the following correspondence,
was frequently turned into bitter sarcasm.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right padr10"><i>Vienna,</i></p>
<p class="right padr3"><i>Wednesday before Christmas-day.</i></p>

<p class="right">(<i>I have no almanack at hand, so do</i></p>
<p class="right padr3"><i>not know the day.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Parents and Sisters</span>,</p>

<p>It was seven weeks, yesterday, since I left you.
What for? But it is so, and cannot be helped.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DANCING AT THE HOUSE OF A JEWESS.</span>
I was invited, yesterday, at the very hour that I
was conducted to Wola, to a little dancing party, at
the Weiberheimʼs. There were several handsome
young people there, not old-fashioned looking, that
is, not Old Testament-looking.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>I was pressed to join the Cotillon; so I went
round a few times and then returned home. The
hostess and her amiable daughters had asked several
musical people, but I was not in a humour for playing
the piano.</p>

<p>Herr Likl, who knows Louise, was introduced to
me. He is a good, honest German, and thinks me
a great man; so I would not destroy his good
opinion by playing when I was not in the right
mood. I also spoke to Lampiʼs nephew, who knows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>Papa well. He is a handsome, agreeable young
man, and paints very well. <i>A propos</i> of painting,
Hummel and his son were with me yesterday.
The latter has now almost finished my portrait.
It is so good, one cannot imagine it better. I am
sitting in my dressing-gown, with a look of inspiration
which I do not know why the artist should have
given me. The portrait is in quarto size, drawn in
chalk, and looks like a steel engraving. The elder
Hummel was exceedingly polite, and introduced
me to his old acquaintance, M. Duport, director of
the Kärthner-Thor Theatre. The latter, who has
been a celebrated dancer, is said to be very stingy;
however, he was exceedingly complaisant to me,
thinking, perhaps, that I should play gratuitously
for him. He makes a mistake there! We had a
sort of conference together, but nothing definite was
decided on. If Herr Duport offers too little, I shall
give my concert in the large Redoubt Hall.</p>

<p>Würfel is better; I met Slawick, an excellent
violinist,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> at his house last week. He is at the
most twenty-six, and pleased me very much. When
we left Würfelʼs he asked me if I were going home,
to which I replied in the affirmative. “Come with me
instead, to your countrywomanʼs, Frau Beyerʼs,” said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Slawick. I agreed. Now Kraszewski had sent me,
the same day, from Dresden, a letter to Frau Beyer,
but without any address, and Beyer is a common
name in Vienna. So I resolved at once to fetch my
letter and go with Slawick; when, lo and behold! I
really went to the right Frau Beyer. Her husband
is a Pole from Odessa. She declared that she had
heard of me, and invited both Slawick and myself
to dinner the next day.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SLAWICKʼS GOOD PLAYING.</span>
After dinner Slawick played, and pleased me
immensely, more than any one since Paganini.
As my playing was also agreeable to him, we
determined to compose a duet together for violin
and piano. I had thought of doing so in Warsaw.
Slawick is, indeed, a great and talented violinist.
When I become acquainted with Merk, we shall be
able to manage a trio. I hope to meet him soon at
Mechettiʼs.</p>

<p>Czerny was with me at Diabelliʼs, yesterday; the
latter invited me to a <i>soirée</i> on Monday next, where
I am to meet none but artists. On Sunday there is
a soirée at Liklʼs, where the aristocratic musical
world assemble, and the Overture for four performers
is to be given. On Saturday there is to be
a performance of old church music at Kiesewetterʼs
(author of a work on music.)</p>

<p>I am living on the fourth floor; some English
people took such a fancy to my abode, that they
said they would rent it of me for eighty gulden; a
proposal to which I acceded most willingly. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>young and agreeable hostess, Frau Baroness of
Lachmanowicz, sister-in-law of Frau von Uszakow,
has just as roomy apartments on the fourth storey for
twenty gulden, which satisfy me quite well. I know
you will say, “the poor wretch lives in a garret.”
But it is not so; there is another floor between me
and the roof, and eighty gulden are not to be despised
either. People visit me notwithstanding; even Count
Hussarzweski took the trouble to mount up. The
street is in an advantageous position for me, in the
midst of the city, close to where I most often want
to go. Artaria is at the left, Mechetti and Haslinger
are at my right, and the Royal Opera Theatre is
behind. Could I have anything more convenient?</p>

<p>I have not yet written to Herr Elsner, but I was
at Czernyʼs just now. Up till to-day, the Quartett
has not appeared.</p>

<p>Dr. Malfatti scolded me for appearing at Madame
Schaschekʼs to dinner at four instead of two. I am
to dine with Malfatti again next Saturday, and if I
am late again, Malfatti will—so he threatens—subject
me to a painful operation.</p>

<p>I can imagine dear Papa looking grave over my
frivolity, and want of respect to my elders; but I
will improve. I am proud to say that Malfatti is
really fond of me. Nidecki comes to me every day
to play. If my concerto for two pianos succeeds to
my satisfaction, we are going to play it together in
public, but I shall play alone first.</p>

<p>Haslinger is always pleasant, but does not say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
a word about publishing. Shall I go shortly to
Italy, or shall I wait?<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> Dearest Papa, please tell
me what are your and dear Mammaʼs wishes.</p>

<p>I daresay Mamma is glad I did not return to
Warsaw, but how I should like to be there!
Embrace dear Titus for me, and beg him to write
me a few words.</p>

<p>I know you believe in my affection and deep
attachment; but you can scarcely imagine what a
very great delight your letters are to me. Why is
not the post quicker? You will think it natural that
I should be very anxious about you, and impatiently
await news of you.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">AN AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE.</span>
I have made a very agreeable acquaintance, a
young man of the name of Leibenfrost; he is a
friend of Kesslerʼs. We meet frequently, and when
I am not invited out we dine together in the city.
He knows Vienna perfectly, and will be sure to take
me to see whatever is worth seeing. For instance,
yesterday, we had a splendid walk to the fortifications;
Dukes, Princes, Counts, in a word, all the
aristocracy of Vienna were assembled there. I met
Slawick, and we agreed to choose a Beethoven theme
for our Variations.</p>

<p>For some reasons I am very glad that I am here,
but for others!...</p>

<p>I am very comfortable in my room; there is a
roof opposite, and the people walking below look like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>dwarfs. I am most happy, when I have played to
my heartʼs content on Graffʼs magnificent instrument.
Now I am going to sleep with your letters
in my hand; then I shall dream only of you.</p>

<p>The Mazurka was danced, yesterday, at Beyerʼs.
Slawick fell down with his partner, an old Countess
with a coarse face and a large nose, who daintily
held her dress in the old-fashioned way, by the tips
of her fingers, her head resting on the flap of his
coat. But all respect to the couple, and to the lady
in particular, who is sensible and entertaining and
knows the <i>usage du monde</i>.</p>

<p>Among the most popular of the numerous amusements
of Vienna are the Garden Concerts, where
Launer and Strauss play waltzes while the public
sup. After every waltz the musicians receive a
boisterous bravo. If an <i>ad libitum</i> is played, introducing
favourite operatic melodies, songs, and dances,
the enthusiasm of the Viennese knows no bounds.</p>

<p>I wanted to send you with this my last Waltz, but
the post goes, and I have no time to write it out, so
must wait till another opportunity. The Mazurkas,
too, I must get copied first; but they are not for
dancing.</p>

<p>I do not like to say goodbye already; I would
gladly write more. If you should see Fontana tell
him that he shall soon have a letter from me.
Matuszynski will have a long epistle either to-day or
by the next post.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">“SECOND ONLY TO PAGANINI.”</span>
I have just come from hearing the famous
violinist, Slawick, who is second only to Paganini.
He takes sixty-nine staccato notes at one stroke of
the bow! It is almost incredible! When I heard
him I wanted to rush home and sketch out some
variations for piano and violin on an Adagio by
Beethoven; but a glance at the post office, which I
always pass (that I may ask for letters from home),
diverted my desires.</p>

<p>The tears which this heavenly theme brought to
my eyes have moistened your letter. I long, unspeakably,
for a word from you; you know why.</p>

<p>How any news of my angel of peace always
delights me!</p>

<p>How gladly would I touch the strings which
should awaken not only stormy feelings, but the
songs whose half echoes still haunt the shores of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>Danube—songs sung by the warriors of King John
Sobieski.</p>

<p>You advised me to choose a poet. But you know
that I am an indecisive being, and only once in my
life made a good choice.</p>

<p>I would not willingly be a burden to my father;
were I not afraid of that, I should immediately
return to Warsaw. I am often in such a mood that
I curse the moment in which I left my beloved
home. You will, I am sure, understand my condition,
and that since Titus went away too much
has fallen suddenly upon me. The numerous
dinners, <i>soirées</i>, concerts, and balls I am obliged to
attend only weary me. I am melancholy. I feel so
lonely and deserted here, yet I cannot live as I like.
I have to dress, and look cheerful in drawing rooms;
but when I am in my room again, I talk to my piano,
to whom, as my best friend in Vienna, I pour out all
my sorrows. There is not a soul I can unreservedly
confide in, and yet I have to treat everyone as a
friend. Plenty of people seem, indeed, to like me,
take my portrait, and seek after my company, but
they do not make up for you. I have lost my peace
of mind, and only feel happy when I can read your

<p><span class="sidenote">A LOVERʼS ANXIETIES.</span>
Pray forgive me, dear Hänschen, for writing so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
complainingly, but my heart feels lighter when I can
thus talk to you, and I have always told you everything
that concerned myself. Did you receive a
short letter from me the day before yesterday?
Perhaps my scribbling is not of much consequence
to you as you are at home, but I read your letters
again and again.</p>

<p>Dr. Freyer, having learnt from Schuch that I was
in Vienna, has been to see me two or three times.
He gave me a great deal of interesting news, and
was very pleased with your letters, which I read to
him up to a certain passage, which passage made me
feel very sad. Does she really look so changed?
Do you think she was ill? She is of such a
sensitive nature that this is not at all unlikely.
But, perhaps, it was only your imagination, or
she had been frightened by something. God forbid
that she should suffer anything on my account!
Comfort her, and assure her that as long as my
heart beats I shall not cease to adore her. Tell
her that, after my death, my ashes shall be spread
beneath her feet. But this is not half what you
might say to her on my behalf. I would write to
her myself, and, indeed, should have done so long
ago, to escape the torments I endure, but if my
letter chanced to fall into other hands, might it not
injure her reputation? So you must be the interpreter
of my thoughts; speak for me, “et jʼen conviendrai.”
These words of yours flashed through
me like lightning, when I read your letter. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>Viennese, who happened to be walking with me at
the time, seized me by the arm, and could scarcely
hold me in. He could not make out what had
come to me. I could have embraced and kissed
all the passers by, for your first letter had made my
heart feel lighter than it had been for many a day.</p>

<p>I am sure I must be wearying you, my dear
friend, but it is difficult for me to hide from you
anything that touches my heart. The day before
yesterday I dined with Frau Beyer, who is also
called Constantia. I enjoy visiting her very much,
because she bears a name so unspeakably dear to
me; I even rejoice if one of her pocket-handkerchiefs
or serviettes marked “Constantia” falls
into my hands. Slawick is a friend of hers, and I
often go to her house with him.</p>

<p>Yesterday, as on Christmas Eve, we played in the
fore and afternoon. The weather was spring-like.
As I was returning in the evening from the Baronessʼs
circle, I walked slowly into St. Stephenʼs. I was
alone, for Slawick was obliged to go to the Imperial
Chapel. The church was empty, and, to get the full
effect of the lofty and imposing edifice, I leant
against a pillar in the darkest corner. The vastness
and splendour of the arching are indescribable: one
must see St. Stephenʼs for oneʼs self. The profoundest
silence, broken only by the resounding
steps of the vergers coming to light the tapers,
reigned around.</p>

<p>Before and behind me, indeed everywhere but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
overhead, were graves, and I felt my loneliness and
desertion as I never had before. When the lights
had burned up, and the cathedral began to fill, I
muffled myself in my cloak (you know how I used
to go about in the Cracow suburb), and hastened off
to the Mass at the Imperial Chapel. Amid a merry
crowd, I threaded my way to the palace, where
I heard some sleepy musicians play three movements
of a mass. I returned home at one oʼclock in the
morning, and went to bed to dream of you, of her,
and of my dear children.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>Next morning I was awakened by an invitation
to dinner from Frau Elkan, a Polish lady, and the
wife of a well-known wealthy banker. The first
thing I did that day was to play some melancholy
fantasias, and, after receiving calls from Nidecki,
Liebenfrost, and Steinkeller, I went to dine with
Malfatti. This excellent man thinks of everything;
he even goes so far as to provide dishes cooked
in Polish fashion.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE STARS OF THE ROYAL OPERA.</span>
Wildt, the famous tenor, came after dinner. I
accompanied him, from memory, in an air from
“Otello,” which he sang admirably. Wildt and
Fraulein Heinefetter are the stars of the Royal
opera; the other singers are not so good as one
would expect. But a voice like Heinefetterʼs is
very rare; her intonation also is always pure, her
colouring refined, and, indeed, her singing altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>faultless; but she is cold; I nearly got my nose
frozen in the pit. She looks particularly handsome
as a man. I liked her better in “Otello” than in
“Barbiere,” in which she represented the consummate
coquette, instead of the lively witty girl.
As Sextus in “Titus” she was exceedingly brilliant.
In a few days she will appear in “Der Diebische
Elster,” which I am curious to see. Fräulein
Wolkow pleased me better as Rosine in the
“Barbiere,” but she certainly has not the voice
of Heinefetter. I wished I had heard Pasta.</p>

<p>You know that I have letters from the Saxon
court to the Viceroy of Milan, but what had I best
do? My parents leave me to follow my own wishes,
but I would rather they had given me directions.
Shall I go to Paris? Friends here advise me to
stay in Vienna. Or shall I go home, or stay here
and kill myself? Advise me what to do. Please
ask a certain person in Warsaw, who has always
had great influence over me. Tell me her opinion,
and I will act upon it.</p>

<p>Let me hear again before you go to the war.
Address, Poste Restante, Vienna. Do go and see
my dear parents and Constantia; and, as long as
you are in Warsaw, please pay frequent visits to my
sisters that they may think you are coming to see
me, and I am in the next room; sit with them
that they may fancy it is me; in a word, take my
place at home.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ALOYS SCHMITT. THALBERG.</span>
I am not thinking any more of concert-giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
just now. Aloys Schmitt, the pianist from Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
whose studies are so famous, is
here at present. He is something over forty years
of age. I have made his acquaintance, and he
promised to come and see me. He intends giving
a concert, and it must be admitted that he is a
clever musician. On musical matters we shall, I
think, soon understand one another.</p>

<p>Thalberg is also here, and playing famously, but
he is not the man for me. He is younger than I am,
very popular with the ladies, makes <i>pot-pourris</i> on the
“Mutes,” plays <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i> with the pedals, but
not with his hands, takes tenths as I do octaves, and
wears diamond studs. He does not at all admire
Moscheles; so it is not surprising that the <i>tutti</i> were
the only part of my concerto that pleased him. He,
too, writes concertos.</p>

<p>I finish this letter three days after I began it, and
have read through my stupid scribble again. Pray
excuse having to pay the postage, dear Hänschen.
When dining to-day at the Italian restaurant, I
heard some one say, “God made a mistake in
creating Poland.” Is it any wonder that my feelings
are more than I can express? Somebody else said,
“There is nothing to be got out of Poland,” so you
ought not to expect anything new from me who
am a Pole.</p>

<p>There is a Frenchman here who makes all kinds
of sausages, and for a month past crowds have
gathered round his attractive shop, for there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>something new in it every day. Some people
imagine that they are beholding the remains of the
French Revolution, and look compassionately at the
sausages and hams, which hang up like pictures,
or they are indignant at the revolutionary Frenchman
being allowed to open a meat shop, as there
were quite enough pigs in his own country. He
is the talk of Vienna, and there is a general dread
that if there should be a disturbance the French
will be at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>I must close, for the time is quite up. Embrace
all my dear friends for me, and be assured that I
shall not leave off loving you till I have ceased
to love my parents, my sisters, and her. My
dearest, do write me a few lines soon. You can
show this to her if you like. I am going to
Malfattiʼs again to-day, but to the post first. My
parents do not know of my writing to you. You
can tell them, only donʼt show them the letter.</p>

<p>I do not know how to part from my sweet
Hänschen. Depart, you wretch! If W—— loves
you as warmly as I do, so would Con ..... No,
I cannot even write the name, my hand is too
unworthy. Oh! I should tear my hair out if I
thought she forgot me: I feel a regular Othello
to-day. I was about to fold and seal the letter
without an envelope, forgetting that it was going
where everybody reads Polish. As I have a little
space left, I will describe my life here.</p>

<p>I am living on the fourth floor in a handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
street, but I have to be on the alert if I want to see
what passes. When I come home you will see the
room in my new album, young Hummel having
kindly made me a drawing of it. It is spacious, and
has five windows, to which the bed stands opposite.
My wonderful piano stands on the right, the sofa
on the left, a looking-glass between the windows,
a large handsome round mahogany table in the
middle of the room; the floor is waxed. Donʼt
be alarmed!...</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DIVISION OF THE DAY.</span>
“The gentleman does not receive in the afternoon,”
so I can be in your midst in thought. The
intolerably stupid servant wakes me early; I rise,
take my coffee, which is often cold, because I forget
my breakfast over my music. My German teacher
appears punctually at 9 oʼclock; then I generally
write, Hummel comes to work at my portrait, and
Nidecki to study my Concerto. I keep on my
comfortable dressing-gown till 12 oʼclock, at which
hour Dr. Leibenfrost, a lawyer here, comes in to
see me. Weather permitting, I walk with him on
the Glacis, then we dine at the “Zum Bömischen
Köchin,” the <i>rendezvous</i> of the students from the
Academy, and afterwards, according to the custom
here, we go to one of the best coffee-houses. Then
I make calls, returning home at dusk, when I throw
myself into evening dress, and go to a <i>soirée</i>.
About 11 or 12 oʼclock (never later) I come home,
play, laugh, read, and then go to bed and dream
of you.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>My portrait—which is a secret between you and
me—is very good. If you think she would like it I
could send it through Schuch, who will probably
leave here with Freyer, about the 15th of next
month. I began to write this letter quite clearly,
but I have finished it in such a way that you will
have some trouble in reading it. Embrace my
college friends, and, if possible, get them to write
to me. Kindest love to Elsner.</p>

<hr />
<p>To the same.</p>

<p class="right"><i>New Yearʼs Day, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Heart</span>,</p>

<p>Now you have what you wanted. Did you
receive the letter, and deliver any of it? I still
regret what I have done. I was full of sweet hopes,
and <i>now</i> I am tormented with doubt and anxiety.
Perhaps she scorns me, or laughs at me! Perhaps—oh,
does she love me? asks my throbbing heart.
You good-for-nothing Esculapius. You were in the
theatre with your opera glasses, and did not take
your eyes off her! If that is so, confound it....
Do not make light of my confidence, but I only
write to you for my own sake; you are not worth
the trouble. Now you know all my thoughts.
When you are in your room with your old friends
Rostowski, Schuch, Freyer, Kyjewski, and Hube,
imagine that I am enjoying myself with you, but
oh! I feel so strange in writing to you here. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
seems as if I were with you, and what I see and
hear around me only a dream. The voices to which
my ear is unaccustomed seem to me only like the
rattling of a carriage, or some other unimportant
sound. Only your or Titusʼs voice could wake me
out of my stupor. To-day, life and death are
indifferent to me. Say nothing of this to my parents.
Tell them that I am in capital spirits, that I want
for nothing, am enjoying myself gloriously, and never
feel lonely. Tell her the same, if she laughs at me,
but if she asks kindly after me, and seems anxious
about me, whisper to her not to be uneasy, but say
that I am very lonely and unhappy away from her.
I am not well, but do not tell my parents. All my
friends are asking what ails me; “humour,” I sometimes
say, but you know what is really the matter.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FEELS LONELY IN VIENNA.</span>
At the end of next month I shall go to Paris, if
things remain quiet there. There is no lack of
amusements here, but I very seldom care to participate
in them. Merk, the first violinist in Vienna,
has promised me a visit. This is the first of January.
Oh, what a sad beginning of the year for me! I
love you dearly. Write as soon as possible. Is
she at Radom? Have you built forts? My poor
parents! How are my friends? I would die for
you, for any of you. Why am I condemned to stay
here, lonely and forsaken? You who are together,
can comfort one another in these fearful times. Your
flute will have enough to mourn over? How my
piano will weep itself out!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>You write that you are going to take the field with
your regiment; how will you forward the letter?
Do not send it by a messenger; be careful! My
parents might—they might misunderstand.</p>

<p>Once more I embrace you. You are going to the
war; come back a colonel. May all go well! Why
can I not at least be your drummer? Excuse this
rambling letter, for I feel quite dazed.</p>

pupil, but he was not, therefore, helped in his compositions by
his teacher. Prince Ferdinand—called Louis Ferdinand in
history, and on the title pages of his compositions—was of an
inventive nature, and what works he has left are really the
produce of his own brain. Full of patriotism and courage, he

His thoughts of her are interwoven into all the compositions
which he wrote at that time. Dreaming of her, he wrote the
Adagio of the E minor Concerto; his desire of leaving Warsaw
vanished; she entirely filled the soul of the passionate youth
of twenty. Constantia Gladkowska, a pupil of Soliva, was
married in 1832, and left the stage, to the great regret of all
connoisseurs.</p></div>
